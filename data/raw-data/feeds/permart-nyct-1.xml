		<art1_title>Magic Realism in Kingsbridge</art1_title>
		<art1_date>2008</art1_date>
		<art1_material>Faceted glass in platform windscreens</art1_material>
		<art1_description>In the past it might have been easy for Kingsbridge area residents to go about their daily business without a thought given to their neighborhood's history and surroundings-places like  Kingsbridge Hills, Ewen Park, Harlem River, Jerome Park Reservoir, and Spuyten Duyvil Creek. This is no longer the case. Felipe Galindo's {Magic Realism in Kingsbridge} stems from his study of the area's residents and his hopes that the imagery in his designs will engage the audience, inspiring them to meditate on their surroundings and see things they take for granted in a different way. *Galindo says he sought to discover the unexpected treasures in the neighborhood-its life, diversity, nature, and most of all the power of imagination. Each element in the faceted glass panels presents a surprising scene. For example, a tropical island is found in the Harlem River, and a fire escape leads to the heavens, providing a sense of magic.  Galindo feels that his artwork, with its combination of urban, natural, surreal and historical elements, provides an opportunity for viewers to experience something intriguing or surprising each time they pass through the 231 Street subway station.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The artist created ceramic tile reliefs that reveal the grace of birds in flight.   Wopo Holup is concerned with integrating artwork into the site and finds inspiration in nature, and says, "I like to think about how people will participate with the work, how they will move by, around, through, or over it.   With this movement in mind I have made works using several sculptural elements linking areas of a site into a single concept.  I looked at the station's existing tile frieze and continued the frieze as a relief tile band.   The relief shows a flight of birds - gold when they fly through the gold band and white as they travel over the white tile of the stairwells. I thought of the birds as flying along with the people as both ascend the stairs to the train's elevated platform."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The artist visited the Washington Heights community and saw a diverse neighborhood, filled with children.  His response was a glass mosaic of a soaring couple dancing in an idyllic landscape and two faceted glass windows of children at play.  The artist says that he wanted something that would be uplifting and that he was inspired by the imagery and symbolism of early Renaissance murals, especially those of Piero della Francesca, known for their serenity and clarity.

		<art1_description>Steve Wood's artwork consists of 160 eight-by-eight-inch bronze relief tiles (80 on the uptown platform and 80 on the downtown side) that have been placed within the platform walls of the station.  The tiles portray the fossilized remains of a variety of biological life forms.  The artist's intent was to bring to the surface, in a subterranean public space, an exploration of the nature of what is found underground, usually through excavation.  In his words, "The idea behind {Fossils} is simple: the subway is underground, fossils are found in the earth...I wanted these reliefs to be 'scattered' over the walls of the northbound and southbound platforms in such a way that both children and adults would see them personally and close-up. They are meant to be looked at, touched, talked about, and remembered."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>With this art work, an oversized and grand chair made of steel, artist Michelle Greene introduces humor into the station.  The chair's design echoes subway motifs and achieves the subway founders' design mission to make the subway a pleasant and hospitable place.   "I wanted to create a whimsical environment that allows the commuter to feel special as opposed to alienated," says the artist.  "I believe that art in a public space has the potential to stir people from their daily routine."  Rider comments show that the art succeeds in doing so, as transit users engage in conversation and interact with the chair while waiting on the platform.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Westside Views} began when the local Community Board recommended that developer amenity funds be used for a youth project to benefit the community.   The result was a collaboration between Nitza Tufi&ntilde;o and 17 young people, most of whom were part of Grosvenor Neighborhood House's school equivalency and educational program. The team went into area streets to photograph important historic sites and interviewed members of the community, ultimately creating 40 ceramic tiles based on their work.  The murals are permanently installed as a testament to the success of the project.  Speaking of her work, Tufi&ntilde;o says: "As an artist, if I take my brushes and my skills and I invest in the lives of young people, then others can see what is possible...  I believe human beings can do anything, if we find something that would positively influence them."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Laced Canopy} has over 100 decorative glass mosaic panels - over one million fragments of glass - installed in the skylight of the subway control house, the first above-ground station house built in New York in over a century. The work's light and lacy effect is achieved from trapping the mosaic fragments between two sheets of specially fabricated glass.  The knots interwoven into the composition are also representations of musical notes from Giuseppe Verdi's opera {Rigoletto}, referencing Verdi Park, in which the station is located, and the nearby Metropolitan Opera.  Robert Hickman describes the sparkling canopy as "a delicate covering of crushed diamonds."  Nineteenth-century English sources inform the work, whose concept is based on the 1851 London Crystal Palace; William Morris fabric and wallpaper designs, as well as Greco-Roman knot patterns, are incorporated as motifs.</art1_description>

Spero conveys this through the use of iconic images of women both real and mythical, from such varied sources as archaeology, architecture, mythology and the contemporary world. *In {Artemis, Acrobats, Divas, and Dancers}, the central icon of opera, the Diva, is repeated in various forms that lead and follow riders through the station, giving the illusion of movement and change.  Elsewhere, Spero represents scenes from the subway and the city outside, the architectural backgrounds enlivened by musicians performing and athletes running, signaling you are in a creative and energetic place, the Upper West Side of Manhattan.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>A monumental and vibrant porcelain tile wall drawing by Sol LeWitt has been installed at 59th Street-Columbus Circle. The artist created the proposal in 2004 and, working with Dattner Architects, selected the site in an expansive wall facing a double-wide stairway and landing that leads from the mezzanine to the platforms of the A, C, B, D and 1 trains. Titled {Whirls and twirls (MTA)}, the artwork is 53 feet wide and by 11 feet high and consists of 250 porcelain tiles in six colors, each cut to meet the artist's specifications. The artist created the drawing/maquette for the project, reviewed and selected materials, and approved color samples prior to his death in 2007. *The artist is known for his sculptures and his wall drawings, in which detailed directions are provided for the execution of the artwork in paint or pencil. The site-specific piece - unique because it is a permanent public installation of a wall drawing - is a bravura work of precision, with swooping curves and vertical and horizontal bars in vibrant color that completely fills the space. The tile was cut to the exact dimensions of the drawing to ensure that the scale of the work and the color sequences are as the artist intended. *Sol LeWitt (1928-2007) is a celebrated artist who has had hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries worldwide since 1965. His work includes more than 1,100 wall drawings, photographs, hundreds of works on paper, and geometry-based sculptures. An exhibition at Mass MOCA in North Adams, Massachusetts, features 105 wall drawings in a specially designed museum space and will be on view through 2033.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>In this series of mosaic panels, titled {Alice: The Way Out}, Liliana Porter's silhouetted figures portray characters from Lewis Carroll's {Alice in Wonderland}.  The simple and engaging quality of the works echo the stagecraft found in the Broadway theaters nearby.  The artist evokes the idea of the theatrical and playfully connects it with the experience of being underground, as was Alice during her adventures.   Commenting on what is below the surface, Porter shows Alice pulling back a curtain to reveal the drama.  Porter prefers to let the viewer's imagination fill in the details of her shadowy figures, playing on our varying views of reality while entertaining her captive audience.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The work of art, {Times Square} is an invisible, deliberately unmarked area of sound at the north end of the pedestrian island at Broadway between 46th and 45th Streets. Conceived and originally installed by artist Max Neuhaus, it provides a rich harmonic sound texture that emerges from a large underground vault covered by a grating. *Commenting on artwork, Neuhaus has said, "For those who find and accept the work's anomaly, the island becomes a different place, separate, but including its surroundings. People, having no way of knowing that it has been deliberately made, usually claim the work as a place of their own discovering." *Installed by the artist in 1977, the artwork remained active until 1992, when Neuhaus moved abroad. In 2002 it was reinstated with the help of the Times Square Business Improvement District, MTA Arts for Transit, and the Dia Art Foundation, which will assume responsibility for its upkeep.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Times Square Mural} captures the spirit of the subway, its linear movement and dynamic energy.  With a nod to both the past and the future- its central image is a futuristic bullet shaped car zipping through an underground station.  And not just any station, this is Times Square, in the heart of New York City. *Lichtenstein was born in New York in 1923 and spent his last years here.  {Times Square Mural} reflects his career, with references to, and variations on, his earlier works.  Lichtenstein also freely appropriated and incorporated images from the works of other artists and designers in his work.  For instance, the hooded figure at the right of the mural is from the old Buck Rogers comic strips and the iconic 42 image is from a series of drawings of the architectural detail of the subway.  It is a signature work that honors its creator and the place in which it is located.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Jack Beal uses classical mythology to comment on the relationship between what is above and below the surface - an apt metaphor for the subway.  The work consists of two large mosaic panels that illustrate the mythological character Persephone.  Instead of fasting, she ate a pomegranate and as punishment, is banished underground for six months of the year.  However, she is permitted to spend six months above ground on earth with her mother.  In mythology, the periods above and below ground were the beginning of seasons, which Beal uses in his titles.  Beal finds universality in the myth and brings it to life in a place filled with movement and purpose, bringing beauty underground.</art2_description>

		<art3_description>Think of Times Square and a variety of images, sights, sounds, and scents come to mind.  Whatever they are, chances are you will find it in {Times Square: 35 Times}, a series of artworks encased within glass blocks and set into the walls of the station.  Toby Buonagurio conceived the work around three themes emblematic of the energetic vibrancy of midtown Manhattan: performing arts, fashion, and street life - all recognizable to the everyday passerby and to the thousands of tourists who visit the city.  The ceramics are installed in illuminated shadowboxes throughout the Times Square subway station complex.</art3_description>

		<art4_description>The enormous mosaic mural is the focal point of the mezzanine in the Times Square subway complex.  Its shimmering and detailed surface pays tribute to the diversity and strength of New York City - its neighborhoods, cultural life, recreational pleasures, love of sports and, of course, its subway system.  {New York in Transit} was Jacob Lawrence's last public work.  In it he evokes city life seen from an elevated train and the sensitive and loving portrait shows a slice of city life and is a parting gift to New York City, seen by millions of people who live and visit here.</art4_description>

		<art5_date>2008</art5_date>
		<art5_material>Glass mosaic in lower mezzanine and 41st Street passageway between Port Authority and Times Square</art5_material>
		<art5_description>It's been said that if you stand long enough in Times Square, you will meet everyone you've ever known. Long known as the crossroads of the world, Times Square is famous for many things, but mostly for its crowds, particularly the spirited celebration each New Year's Eve when hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and visitors-joined by television viewers around the world, gather to watch the ball drop to usher in the New Year. Sharing hopes for the future, the huge crowds are televised against a neon background.  *In {The Revelers}, Jane Dickson celebrates this age-old impulse to gather. Her mosaic artwork consists of approximately 70 expressive life-size figures. Each is in motion, walking, gesturing, linking arms, or dancing; all enjoying themselves and each other's company. The central frieze of figures are presaged by a scattering of figures in groups of two or three walking in both directions along the corridors that lead to the central open space of the station complex, near the stairs to the 1, 2, 3 lines. These smaller groups share the space with commuters traveling through the passageways that connect the subway stations at Seventh and Eighth Avenues.</art5_description>

		<art1_description>In her series of mosaics, Grajales shows wild beasts in a pastoral setting, reminiscent of the 19th-century paintings such as the "Peaceable Kingdom" by Edward Hicks.  One features a pair of lions happily coexisting with birds.  A nearby stream (representing the Hudson River) with cliffs behind (the Palisades in New Jersey) form the backdrop.  In another mosaic, a bear contentedly watches a doe and her young.  Other panels show birds in flight and nesting.  "As a child on shopping trips," notes Grajales, "I found the station dull and colorless.  I wanted to give people something cheerful but also calming - a refuge in the city.  That's why I used gentle colors like golden ochre and pale blues and greens for these idyllic Garden of Eden scenes."

		<art1_date>1994</art1_date>
		<art1_material>Ceramic mosaic on platform walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Depicting vignettes of community history, The {Greenwich Village Murals} consist of children's composite drawings inspired and guided by an artist concerned with "identity" and its portrayal.  Lee Brozgol first intended to devote each of the four panels to one famous person. "But the village is so rich in amazing characters who shaped America that picking only twelve was impossible," he says.  With students from Greenwich Village's P.S. 41, he found space for some forty people arranged in four groupings: {Founders, Providers, Bohemians, and Rebels} - bending time to group them together.  Deborah Lewis, a teacher at P.S. 41, helped Brozgol select nine fifth and sixth graders for the project.  The resulting presentation recognizes the many individuals who gave the neighborhood its reputation as a cauldron of artistic and political activity.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Glass mosaic on platform walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Brown's seven glass mosaics are given a whimsical quality, as the artist creates aquatic creatures that act like humans as they wait for the train to arrive at their underwater station.  A realistic beluga whale slides behind a commuter to read the newspaper headlines, and in another scene, a manatee waits patiently for a train seen approaching in the tunnel.  Turtles dive off a subway platform in the title piece of the series.  "I wanted to explore the analogy between subway travel and the movement of our fellow creatures through their natural environment," Brown says.  "Underwater creatures navigate a complex spatial array of undersea passageways, much as we maneuver through our own manmade systems.  I thought it would be provocative to portray them in a part of our world most closely resembling their own, but involved in activities familiar to us."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Oculus} is located in passageways under the World Trade Center and was largely untouched by the events of 9/1l.  {Oculus} will also be visible at the Cortlandt Street Station after construction is completed.  Jones and Ginzel's work consists of over 300 unique mosaic renderings that use the oculus - the eye - as the central symbol.  In their words, "Oculus was created to personalize and integrate the stations.  Eyes are both subtle and strong - they engage passing individuals, allowing for meditation or inviting dialogue."  The eyes are from the artists' photographs taken in New York , which were selected for the diversity of the  subjects' eyes.  An enormous central eye set in the floor, grounds the composition and serves as the centerpiece of a map of the world which radiates outward.</art1_description>

		<art1_description> The new monumental work at the South Ferry Terminal by Mike and Doug Starn investigates the nature of objects and transformation using light and documentary sources. A fused glass wall reveals images of tree limbs and leaves in silhouette adapted from photographic imagery. These formations relate to the place above, Battery Park, the historic fortress and Manhattan's southern boundary. The glass brings light and poetry to the station, the City's first new subway station in decades. *Companion pieces show a decayed over-scaled leaf that refers to the passage of time and links the park to its historical role. A map, that shows contemporary Manhattan and old New York as an overlay, is a beautiful mosaic and eloquent expression of the city's evolution, conveying to the throngs who use the station, a sense of its significant location. The artists designed a laser-cut stainless steel fence to separate the entry from the paid section of the station; its leaf motif connects the art in the station with the surrounding environment. *The Starns' work combines various forms, such as sculpture, painting, video, and installation. Their work has been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide for more than two decades. In South Ferry, their explorations of light and dark, nature and technology, come together in an evocative artwork. Its title refers, among other associations, to the South Ferry subway line, which becomes a network of splitting lines that travels through the changing landscape as seen in the map. As the artwork reveals, the City and its lifelines evolve in an organic form, as dropping leaves lead to new growth, the City keeps growing - and changing.</art1_description>
