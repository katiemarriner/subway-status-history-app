		<art1_material>Faceted glass in mezzanine windows</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{Children at Play}, a series of faceted glass panels, is a study of silhouetted figures moving through space, in various poses and movements - pausing, spinning, crouching, sliding, and running.  Artist Josie Gonzalez Albright chose a palette of jewel tones for the children to take advantage of the luminous quality of the glass.   Speaking of the work she says, "The scale of the children - to each other and the space that they're in - fills the frame with flowing colors that swirl around them.  The effect is that they 'move through the colors' of their environment. Warm shadows are created from the placement of glass crystals that are fused over the glass, which gives...a bubbly, raised texture.  Lots of clear glass allows for light from adjacent colored glass pieces to spill over and create new color combinations throughout the day."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Evoking the original Algonquin meaning of Mosholu smooth stones, {Metromorphosis/Birth of a Station} at the Mosholu Parkway station uses swirling, energetic compositions to evoke the force of rivers over time, which transform rough rocks to smooth stones. *Artist Corinne Grondahl created her work in fused glass, with fourteen panels built into the windscreens on each platform.  The northbound side is named {Metromorphosis} and the southbound side {Birth of a Station}.  The reds and blues can be seen from inside and outside of the station, providing a beacon of beauty at this centrally located station in the Bronx.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Moses Ros' art is created in faceted and laminated glass within a series of windows to realize his vision.  In {Patriasana, Wholesomeland}, figures joyfully dance across the station, their brilliant colors and undulating movements speaking to the vibrancy of the community.  The figures are placed within backgrounds shaped to represent the items on sale in the surrounding shops along Fordham Road - an umbrella, a hat, a coat, boots, pants, and gloves.  The border between the panels and the rectangular window edge is made of translucent glass, that lets in the colors of the street outside to serve as a muted backdrop.  The original images were created as paintings on canvas and carved wood before being translated into fused and faceted glass windows.  The artist says, "Their energy is inspired by the brilliant colors, music, and dance of the Caribbean - the essence of life itself."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>To depict the cultural and history of University Heights, artist Jose Ortiz focused on its architecture, landmarks, and signage on the local streetscape, as a way to portray the people who lived here over time. The title of the work relates to the specific journeys of the areas many residents, from Native Americans, through today's immigrant population and to the idea of travel and how one finds ones way.*The first two panels of the 11panels he created show the land inhabited by the Siwanoy Nation, a branch of the Mohicans, until the late 1600s, followed by representations of the first settlement of Europeans in the area. Cornerstones of the neighborhood are also shown: the Croton Aqueduct, St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church, and the Hall of Fame for Great Americans at Bronx Community College. The work, which is to be read serially, begins and ends with a Native American symbol that refers to the connection between the many people who have call this place home.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Reaching Out for Each Other} by Juan S&aacute;nchez is a series of faceted glass windscreens and windows that brightens the 176th Street station with streaming rays of warm colors.  Hands are used as a central feature of the composition and serve to communicate meaning through a universal language.  Using printed photographs of hundreds of hands, S&aacute;nchez cut and tore the paper, interspersing the pieces with bright colors and interesting shapes to produce a variety of seasonal collages.  S&aacute;nchez explains his concept for the work, "The challenge was to create simple, direct, and consistent works for an urban train station.  I wanted the artwork to be attractive and stimulating with much meaning and life. I wanted my art to visually convey people reaching and striving."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Amir Bey describes {The Procession of Folk #3} as a vision of humanity's collective movements.  Consisting of faceted glass in windscreens and windows,  Bey based the images on the faces of his acquaintances.  With its study of people, {Procession} speaks to all riders in its celebration of individuality.  The artist says, "The identity of each face is specific, never to be repeated, even over thousands of generations, like the delicate changes of any flower's colors and shapes as it adapts to the Sun's motion...The face can be a portrait or a stylized fantasy - even when I'm making a portrait of an individual.  There is so much in the face, which is comprised of only a few components that can form complex expressions with endless variations, speaking a language that is universally understood."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Dina Bursztyn's series of faceted glass windscreens and windows uses the unique vantage point offered from the elevated city's trains and platforms.  Bursztyn became especially well acquainted with the "el" in the Bronx while riding it for many years.  Explaining the inspiration for the work, Bursztyn says that the birds and trees told her stories.  She viewed tiny gardens of lushness and dreamed of the exotic animals living in the zoo nearby.  In the evening, sunsets filled the sky with a kaleidoscope of color.  The train rides almost felt like riding through the clouds.  The artist strove to bring new meaning to familiar locations by sharing these visions.</art1_description>

Elsewhere, protruding and receding walls provide seating for waiting travelers.  Parts of the project thrust through floors and ceilings and at one point even project aboveground.  The overall effect is as if the station has been pushed and pulled in various directions to accentuate the relationship of the building to the earth into which it has been inserted. *This project was one of the first collaborative efforts undertaken by Arts for Transit. The architects, di Domenico   Partners, in their redesign of the station, were challenged to open the lower levels to allow light to flow inside.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>At the Yankee Stadium elevated station, walls that open in Vito Acconci's shifting architectural forms reveal Helene Brandt's Room of Tranquility where all is peaceful, still, and reassuring.  Trees and sky seem real; the space appears to expand and depth is convincingly suggested.  In the artist's words, "I envisioned an imaginary room revealed behind the sliding tile walls - a quiet, restful space with a radiant view to the outside, a room of tranquility.  I wanted the room to have illusionary windows that would seem to let the outside world penetrate into the station."  Brandt rose to the challenge of responding to the site with a work that relates to Acconci's in counterpoint.  As she stated, "I want my {Room of Tranquility} to look as if it has always existed and is only now exposed to view by the sliding tile walls."  Her site-specific achieves a place of serenity, yet close to the roar of the crowds.</art2_description>

Two triangular sections serve as a time capsule of life in Harlem in the 1980s.  "The exploration might be of a place or into our own minds where we find eternal secrets that are saved and put in the time capsules for our children and their children," Conwill says.</art1_description>

Maynard's work consists of glass mosaic murals along mezzanine and stairway walls that bring layers of pattern and color to an abstracted geometric field. Against the backgrounds are figural representations of musicians and others in joyful postures.  Maynard's images, in her words, "capture the boundless energy, the beacon of light that was and is our own homegrown Mecca: the Harlem of our dreams, our imaginings and our reality.  Maynard dedicates the work above the stairwells to artists, in recognition of their "flights of creativity."</art2_description>

		<art1_description>In {Happy City}, Peter Sis depicts four large eyes to represent the ingredients of the community and the vibrancy that is New York.  Created with etched stone and glass mosaics and rendered in bold color, above the stairs, the pupils and eyelashes are "drawn" with buildings from the neighborhood, incorporating such landmarks as the Metropolitan, Guggenheim, and Whitney museums, as well as Gracie Mansion.  The irises and whites of the eyes serve as a background for figurative elements that capture the diversity and energy of the community.  According to the artist, "The [people of the city] have children and want the best for their children, so they tell them stories and fairy tales.  The fairy tales are the magic animals which appear to float in throughout the four murals.  In the end they form the carousel with the happy children of all nationalities enjoying the ride.  That is the future of the city."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Riders at this station are treated to the joyous burst of color and shapes that is {Blooming}.   The mosaics defy the corners of the space as the imagery wraps around corners, down steps, and through doorways. *{Blooming} takes its title from Bloomingdale's, located above the station upstairs.  The artist views the subway as a "dreamy underworld" and also a place to wake up, and her pink trees, red shoes and yellow mugs with steaming coffee succeed in gaining the viewers' attention.  Murray says, "I added the stepping shoes and steaming coffee cups, part of the ritual of every morning or evening subway trip."  The images are intended to  "stimulate thoughts about passage, as does the poetry"  that is incorporated into the mural, lines from William Butler Yeats's, "In dreams begin responsibility,"  Gwendolyn Brooks's "Conduct your blooming in the noise and whip of the whirlwind."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The passageways and waiting areas of Grand Central's subway stations are like a bustling city, an underground community - but without a skyline.  This mosaic artwork brings architectural views down below. *Ferrara has long been interested in the simple and repetitive forms of building, and she uses forms that are simple and schematic, almost primitive-looking structures.  Taken together, they lend a unity and meditative character to the space; as people move through the platforms and passageways, the images seem to shift, and no two vistas are the same.  Ferrara thinks of these as pieces of a mathematical puzzle.  The spare simplicity and economy of design attracts viewers.  Nothing is casual or unintentional in the artist's design, which she describes: "This sequence of stripe/image is calculated.  It can be seen as images on a strip of film, or a line of faces framed in the windows of a passing train."</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Dan Sinclair's {Fast Track and Speedwheels} are assemblages crafted from bright metallic sections that include wavy aluminum sheets, steel wheels, brass disks, copper springs and wires.  Installed within a long passageway between the subway and Grand Central Terminal above, they interpret the speed, energy and train travel imagery into a series of relief sculptures.  The art-deco shapes and various turning wheels, spinning gears and pistons add to the aura of the location, below one of America's premiere rail stations.  "I want my sculpture to make people think of the power of the engines that drive the trains, the speed and efficiency of them . . . the sculptures also reflect the architectural elements of Times Square and the Art Deco glamour of Radio City Music Hall," says the artist.</art2_description>

Artist Christopher Sproat has combined standard transportation hardware - signage, air circulation, and safety equipment - with his artistic sensibility to integrate the sculpture into the transit environment.  The artwork takes the form of a large V, which Sproat judged to be the most practical shape in terms of access and stability, and is equipped with extruded aluminum panels and light-emitting diodes to carry out its functions.  "Rather than make an artistic or decorative statement and add it to the station so that the viewer knows 'this is art,' I chose to make the entire space exuberant and unique," the artist says.</art3_description>

		<art1_description>Mary Miss worked with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy to use the rehabilitation of Union Square station as an opportunity to uncover hidden structural elements, cables, and conduits - some still functional and others replaced by new improvements.  Old decorative work reappeared during construction, such as mosaics, pilasters, name plaques, and six terra cotta eagles from the 1904 station, once presumed lost. *Miss brings these treasures to the surface though a network of frames, windows, apertures, and mirrors. The bright red frames stand out; what they frame is more subtle - a bolt, a fragment of ancient-looking mosaic, a piece of rusted steel cable.  Other frames call attention to the station's historic name plaques.   "I'm inviting the public to look below the surface, to see a 'slice' of the station, its structure, its history, says the artist.  In this most public of places, the apertures offer an intimate engagement.  Looking in, you will see the station's workings - sometimes you will see layers of words and reflected images, including your own!"</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The Brooklyn Bridge's pioneering use of steel cables and a suspended roadway are repeatedly referenced in the design of artist Mark Gibian's work. Within the west mezzanine a web of cables recalls the graceful forms of the bridge, while overhead a 30-square foot structure, suspended beneath a skylight, frames the cable work.   At the turnstiles, three panels that also use cables serve as a functional barrier.   For the artist, the "lacy" curves of the panels "echo the beauty of the bridge's cross-hatched cables and the feeling of flight as it springs across the East River."  The energy of {Cable Crossing} suggests "the controlled power of the subway and its network of metal and concrete that undergirds the city.   I wanted to explore movement, using soft curves with hard materials," Gibian says.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Nancy Holt's steel ceiling sculpture incorporating lighting at the Fulton Street/Broadway-Nassau subway station, is an example of Arts for Transit's early efforts to foster collaborations with station architects, (in this case, Lee Harris Pomeroy) to integrate the artwork with the architecture.   An environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars. *In {Astral Grating}, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  "The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus, and Piscus Austrinus," says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented. *{The plan for the new Fulton Street Transit Center, includes the reinstallation of Astral Grating  in the reconfigured passageways.}</art1_description>

		<art2_description>At the turn of the twentieth century the McAlpin Hotel was one of the places to be seen.  Frederick Dana Marsh created a series of twenty terra cotta murals for its walls, with maritime themes celebrating New York's important seaport.  Times change, and the hotel became apartments and the murals were removed.  In 2000, six of the murals were installed in the station and was the Marine Grill's famed ironwork entrance gate.  All of this blends well with the terra cotta plaques installed elsewhere in the system by the original builders of the subway. *{The rebuilding of the station, as part of the Fulton Street Transit Center, is underway and requires the murals' removal, restoration, and relocation.}</art2_description>

		<art1_description>{Work &amp; Nature} was inspired by the artist's interest in the Nevins Street station and its aesthetic history.  The artwork consists of porcelain enamel steel plates that use the same soft blue, green, and ochre tones as in the original mosaics, which are detailed with stenciled silhouettes printed in black - a woman operates a sewing machine, an architect reads a blueprint, a mother looks after a child, a man plants a tree, famed blues singer Furry Lewis plays the guitar, and a woman addresses a meeting.  The historic  mosaic patterns that ran along the station's walls were water damaged and on the brink of permanent loss.  Moved by the mosaics' plight, Anton van Dalen decided to preserve "the station's olden elegance and grand beauty" and, at the same time, to create a tribute to the people who use the station.  For the artist, these figures symbolize "the pride, dignity, and beauty surrounding all work."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The array of subway and rail lines at the Atlantic Avenue-Pacific Street and LIRR's Terminal presented a perfect opportunity for an "architect/artist" collaboration to unify passages and stairways, creating a coherent and efficient space.  George Trakas  uses forms and materials that underscore the structure and beauty of the cavernous space. *Trakas selected the stone pavers and bollards for the plaza area.  The architects designed a skylight for the historic station kiosk and Trakas added a small peephole equipped with a lens that provides a view from the street to the light-filled space below.  The viewer spies a boat-shaped gantry of stainless steel and mesh beneath the skylight.  A granite "wave" runs along the walls and crests at the point where the two stations, Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Street, meet - linking the passageways.  Referencing the names {Atlantic} and {Pacific}, the overarching concept is a place of landing and departure - functions shared by train stations and seaports.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>At the Botanic Garden station, community representatives, the station architectural team, and artist Millie Burns created a sensitive visual transition from street to mini-park surrounding the entrance and finally into the transit facility itself.  This is achieved by fences and railing designs.  The tall and wavy metal constructions echo both the trees and stately apartment buildings lining Eastern Parkway and harmonize with the modern lines of the station house.  Most importantly, they lead the way into the station and provide aesthetic uplift for transit users.  "The communities that border Eastern Parkway and the Botanic Garden are blessed with a rich natural bounty," Burns says.  "We are surrounded by trees, shrubs, plants, and vines.  The fences and railing designs are drawn from what I see in this neighborhood.  {IL7/Square} is about growth, a reaching toward the sun."</art1_description>
