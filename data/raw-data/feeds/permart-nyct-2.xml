		<art1_description>In his portrayal of cityscapes with vast colorful skies full of energy and motion, Nicky Enright's faceted glass windows are a tribute to New York.  The artist created dramatic views with oversize skies, minimizing the size of buildings and city.  He plays on space and direction to create fragmented views, contracting the angles of the subway.  The scene shows a calm city under heavens filled with constellations, shooting stars, planets, moons and vibrant sunsets.  Through the artwork, Enright encourages commuters to contemplate, if only for a moment, the mystery and excitement of the city and its place in the universe.</art1_description>

The glassworks bring lively color to the station, providing visual interest and a place for the commuter to concentrate on positive thoughts and energy.  Inspired by life in the city, the artist wanted to convey humanity, community, and harmony through her artwork.  As she explains, "In my work I celebrate nature and humanity, while examining the notions of gender, race and identity.

		<art1_description>In {Bronx Literature}, B&eacute;atrice Coron celebrates the rich literary heritage of the area, and common activity for subway riders.  The Bronx has been the home and inspiration of numerous writers as diverse as Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, Sholem Aleichem, Allen Ginsberg, Chaim Potok, and Cynthia Ozick..  In particular, in {Bronx Literature} Coron portrays four great writers' works including Edgar Allan Poe's {Ulalume and other poems}; Sholem Aleichem's {Mottel, the Cantor's Son}; James Baldwin's {The Fire Next Time}; and Nicholasa Mohr's {El Bronx Remembered}.  The artist explains, "These authors tell the story of the borough from colonial times to suburban and contemporary community developments.  Their works help us travel through time into different social classes and communities, making each of us an insider."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The abstract patterns seen in Michele Brody's faceted glass art are based on subway lines that run from the Bronx through Manhattan to Brooklyn, as represented graphically on the MTA subway map.  In the first stage of the work, Brody extracted the red and green lines and transformed them through a process of extrapolating, twisting, turning, and layering them.  The final product, in faceted-glass, captivates the viewer's attention with interlocking streams of colors.  Fabricated into 20 panels and placed on the subway platform for viewing from inside as well as outside the station, the work is full of movement that reflects the motion of a subway train.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Tomie Arai's {Back to the Garden} consists of 24 faceted glass windows at Pelham Parkway in the Bronx.  The work contains seasonal floral imagery-spring blossoms, summertime wallflowers, and autumn foliage.  The species shown are common to the area of Pelham Parkway, which links Pelham Bay Park with the Bronx Zoo, and New York Botanical Garden.  Highlighting the historic nature of the station and the community, Arai insets historic black and white photographs into her colorful images.  The photos have been screened and fired onto the glass surface.  Taken from archival photographs, they span the period from 1899 to 1969 and capture views of the surrounding streets and buildings.  The artwork's title refers to lyrics in a Joni Mitchell song about returning to the simple life, the life back in the garden.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{B is for Birds in the Bronx}, a series of faceted glass windscreen panels, was inspired by the birds that populate the Bronx.  While they may often not be noticed, birds are present in our urban environment, filling the air with song and the sky with flight.  The artist makes the birds prominent through scale and composition, placing them in the foreground but almost treating them as negative space.  As the artist explains, "I wanted to subvert them by making them white, and make them invisible, large and regal.  The birds in their emptiness give attention to their transparency and how they hold a space for the trees, the bushes, the snow, the branches, the wind, the sky, and the leaves to exist, like a still-life painting...where the space outside of the object, really creates the form of the object... ."</art1_description>

The location of the work at the West Farms Square-East Tremont Avenue station is not coincidental; nearby is the world-famous Bronx Zoo.  The artist says that she considers {Animal Tracks} to be an integration of her past involvement in animal sciences with her art and "a step toward the unity and community feeling paramount to our steps in the future."  {Animal Tracks} serves as an introduction to the zoo to visitors just arriving at the station, and a reminder of the trip to those heading home.</art1_description>

En route, they pass  various neighborhoods, filled with color, pattern, and activity.  The artist also presents typical activities in which the community participates, such as a street festival, mask-making, and the planting of new trees.  Representations of flowers can be found in the station window niches, "simple reflections of nature that surrounds us," says the artist, Daniel Del Valle.  "Even though not everyone can take this magical trip up the river to view these sites, the 2 and 5 trains can provide people easy access to travel to these locations."</art1_description>

Artist Daniel Hauben a Bronx resident, has always been drawn to and inspired by the sense of scale provided by these immense structures when contrasted with their neighborhood settings, and his scenes, translated into faceted glass mosaics, depict the unique character of the Bronx through composition, pattern, light, darkness, and movement through the canvas. Hauben commented, that as one "looks down a long street topped by the receding concentric pattern of the elevated structure, one has a feeling of both great depth and the sprawling vastness of the city."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Urban Renewal} by Lisa Amowitz expresses the notion that structures, although built to last, are fragile entities, while flowers represent the eternal through renewal, rebirth, and rebuilding. For the artist, flowers help us embrace the beautiful mystery of life pulsing through every person in every building of the city. Flowers can be destroyed and still grow back to bloom another season. *This series of faceted glass panels depicts fallen buildings comforted by blooming flowers to signify New York's resilient spirit. It also represents the Bronx, continuously renewing itself and blooming with vibrancy in expected and unexpected places.

Light is a major theme of the piece, especially the burst of light that envelops a subway train when it leaves an underground tunnel and becomes elevated. African and Native American influences are integral to the work, as are arch shapes suggested by tunnels and 'els.'  Charged with energy, color, and music, reflecting myth and dance, these fulfill my wish to continue the tradition of mosaics in New York City's subway system."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Bronx. Four Seasons} is a series of faceted glass compositions illustrating the four seasons with views of the Bronx from the Prospect Avenue station.  The works by artist Marina Tsersarskaya feature the intricate and delicate design of the historic railings found in the station and depict an urban landscape of buildings, trees, and flowers, filtering the bright sunlight through the windows to create a transformed station environment that combines the city and nature into a single artistic vision.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Latin American Stories} at Jackson Avenue station in the Bronx turns the station into a land of fairytales from Latin American myth and folklore. *Installed in four windscreens and two sets of window niches on the north and south platforms, the faceted glass artwork is composed of six stories from different regions of Latin America. Colorful imagery on the southbound platform celebrates myths of rain, wind, and fire, including the Mayan myth "How Frogs Brought Rain to Mexico," the Andean legend of the Condor King, and the Brazilian myth of "How Fire Came to the Rain Forest." *On the northbound platform, images tell tales about love and creation, including "The King That Tried to Touch the Moon from the Lesser Antilles," the story of "The Beginning of the Sea" from the Greater Antilles, and a Latin American version of Cinderella. *Through the fluid rendering of the storylines in each panel, {Latin American Stories} is a picture book that reminds the diverse local community of these ancient stories and entices daily commuters to discover the universal beauty shared by every culture.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Jose Ortega created a series of mosaic panels  inspired by the busy circle of streets above the 149th Street station, referred to locally as "the Hub."  Ortega uses circular forms to invoke universal themes and creates recognizable imagery within an organic and abstract web of patterns.  "The circle is a powerful symbol," he says. "It connotes infinity, implies wholeness.  It has no beginning and no end."  His brightly colored murals focus on three circular images: "the sun as the provider of energy and the center of our universe, the earth as the sustainer of our humanly developed and natural worlds, and the face as the translator, both receptor and interpreter of the human and natural worlds."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Harlem Timeline} serves as a tribute to Harlem luminaries.  In this expansive mosaic mural, they are seen mingling with neighborhood residents.  On the downtown platform, we see Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Langston Hughes, Joe Louis, and Charlie Parker in action.  The blues - both the musical form and the color - are represented on the uptown side, with Billie Holiday, bathed in indigo.  Elsewhere, Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, Paul Robeson, John Coltrane, and Thelonious Monk express themselves, rejoining the community where the Harlem Renaissance all began.  Some of the visual references that Birch weaves into the work are African-American quilts, textile designs of Mexico and Africa, and visionary folk art.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Glass mosaic on platform walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{Flying Home} is a mosaic mural that honors Harlem notables and makes them fly.  The mural on one platform depicts performers, painters, and sports figures like Dinah Washington, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Josephine Baker.  The opposite platform shows leaders like Malcolm X and writer Zora Neale Hurston, brought to life in mosaics that recall the cultural zenith of Harlem.  The title is based on a Lionel Hampton song which Faith Ringgold heard as a child.  The artist sought  to capture its spirit in this work, which she expressed by posing the figures as if they were in flight.  "I love every one of these people," Ringgold says, "I wanted to share those memories, to give the community - and others just passing through - a glimpse of all the wonderful people who were part of Harlem.  I wanted them to realize what Harlem has produced and inspired."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Vincent Smith's mosaic artwork showcases the nightlife, culture, and personalities from Harlem's heyday.  {The Movers and Shakers} portrays sixteen Harlem visionaries in front of the important places in their careers:  Edward "Duke" Ellington and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson at the Apollo Theater, Langston Hughes before the National Black Theater; and Zora Neale Hurston and Alvin Ailey at the Studio Museum. Nearby, Paul Robeson, Marcus Garvey and a young Thurgood Marshall appear.  On the opposite wall, jazz pioneers are rendered as composite figures inspired by Smith's recollections of those who created the new sound.    His musicians energetically play their music against a background of yellows, blues, and greens that hint at Africa and the Caribbean, inspiration for the rhythms and music that is jazz. The title, {Minton's Playhouse} refers to a popular jazz club Smith frequented.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The artwork created for the station honors Malcolm X and consists of quotations within mosaic panels that line the stairway walls at the entrance and an upright wall on the station platform.  Speaking of her work, Maren Hassinger said, "Basically, I wanted to make something that behaved very physically with the site while also honoring the memory of Malcolm X..."  Among the quotations are "{I believe in a society in which people can live like human beings on the basis of equality"}, and "{Nobody's going to straighten out Harlem but us.}"   "The upright wall within the station contains images/symbols of prowess on one side and Malcolm's words on the reverse side, the artist said." Here the idea of power, leadership, and spiritual support are linked.  Malcolm X believed that we as African Americans have the power to determine our destinies.  This station is a reminder of that truth."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Laced Canopy} has over 100 decorative glass mosaic panels - over one million fragments of glass - installed in the skylight of the subway control house, the first above-ground station house built in New York in over a century. The work's light and lacy effect is achieved from trapping the mosaic fragments between two sheets of specially fabricated glass.  The knots interwoven into the composition are also representations of musical notes from Giuseppe Verdi's opera {Rigoletto}, referencing Verdi Park, in which the station is located, and the nearby Metropolitan Opera.  Robert Hickman describes the sparkling canopy as "a delicate covering of crushed diamonds."  Nineteenth-century English sources inform the work, whose concept is based on the 1851 London Crystal Palace; William Morris fabric and wallpaper designs, as well as Greco-Roman knot patterns, are incorporated as motifs.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The work of art, {Times Square} is an invisible, deliberately unmarked area of sound at the north end of the pedestrian island at Broadway between 46th and 45th Streets. Conceived and originally installed by artist Max Neuhaus, it provides a rich harmonic sound texture that emerges from a large underground vault covered by a grating. *Commenting on artwork, Neuhaus has said, "For those who find and accept the work's anomaly, the island becomes a different place, separate, but including its surroundings. People, having no way of knowing that it has been deliberately made, usually claim the work as a place of their own discovering." *Installed by the artist in 1977, the artwork remained active until 1992, when Neuhaus moved abroad. In 2002 it was reinstated with the help of the Times Square Business Improvement District, MTA Arts for Transit, and the Dia Art Foundation, which will assume responsibility for its upkeep.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Times Square Mural} captures the spirit of the subway, its linear movement and dynamic energy.  With a nod to both the past and the future- its central image is a futuristic bullet shaped car zipping through an underground station.  And not just any station, this is Times Square, in the heart of New York City. *Lichtenstein was born in New York in 1923 and spent his last years here.  {Times Square Mural} reflects his career, with references to, and variations on, his earlier works.  Lichtenstein also freely appropriated and incorporated images from the works of other artists and designers in his work.  For instance, the hooded figure at the right of the mural is from the old Buck Rogers comic strips and the iconic 42 image is from a series of drawings of the architectural detail of the subway.  It is a signature work that honors its creator and the place in which it is located.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Jack Beal uses classical mythology to comment on the relationship between what is above and below the surface - an apt metaphor for the subway.  The work consists of two large mosaic panels that illustrate the mythological character Persephone.  Instead of fasting, she ate a pomegranate and as punishment, is banished underground for six months of the year.  However, she is permitted to spend six months above ground on earth with her mother.  In mythology, the periods above and below ground were the beginning of seasons, which Beal uses in his titles.  Beal finds universality in the myth and brings it to life in a place filled with movement and purpose, bringing beauty underground.</art2_description>

Whatever they are, chances are you will find it in {Times Square: 35 Times}, a series of artworks encased within glass blocks and set into the walls of the station.  Toby Buonagurio conceived the work around three themes emblematic of the energetic vibrancy of midtown Manhattan: performing arts, fashion, and street life - all recognizable to the everyday passerby and to the thousands of tourists who visit the city.  The ceramics are installed in illuminated shadowboxes throughout the Times Square subway station complex.</art3_description>

		<art4_description>The enormous mosaic mural is the focal point of the mezzanine in the Times Square subway complex.  Its shimmering and detailed surface pays tribute to the diversity and strength of New York City - its neighborhoods, cultural life, recreational pleasures, love of sports and, of course, its subway system.  {New York in Transit} was Jacob Lawrence's last public work.  In it he evokes city life seen from an elevated train and the sensitive and loving portrait shows a slice of city life and is a parting gift to New York City, seen by millions of people who live and visit here.</art4_description>

		<art5_material>Glass mosaic in lower mezzanine and 41st Street passageway between Port Authority and Times Square</art5_material>
		<art5_description>It's been said that if you stand long enough in Times Square, you will meet everyone you've ever known. Long known as the crossroads of the world, Times Square is famous for many things, but mostly for its crowds, particularly the spirited celebration each New Year's Eve when hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and visitors-joined by television viewers around the world, gather to watch the ball drop to usher in the New Year. Sharing hopes for the future, the huge crowds are televised against a neon background.  *In {The Revelers}, Jane Dickson celebrates this age-old impulse to gather. Her mosaic artwork consists of approximately 70 expressive life-size figures. Each is in motion, walking, gesturing, linking arms, or dancing; all enjoying themselves and each other's company. The central frieze of figures are presaged by a scattering of figures in groups of two or three walking in both directions along the corridors that lead to the central open space of the station complex, near the stairs to the 1, 2, 3 lines. These smaller groups share the space with commuters traveling through the passageways that connect the subway stations at Seventh and Eighth Avenues.</art5_description>

		<art1_description>In her series of mosaics, Grajales shows wild beasts in a pastoral setting, reminiscent of the 19th-century paintings such as the "Peaceable Kingdom" by Edward Hicks.  One features a pair of lions happily coexisting with birds.  A nearby stream (representing the Hudson River) with cliffs behind (the Palisades in New Jersey) form the backdrop.  In another mosaic, a bear contentedly watches a doe and her young.  Other panels show birds in flight and nesting.  "As a child on shopping trips," notes Grajales, "I found the station dull and colorless.  I wanted to give people something cheerful but also calming - a refuge in the city.  That's why I used gentle colors like golden ochre and pale blues and greens for these idyllic Garden of Eden scenes."</art1_description>

Jones and Ginzel's work consists of over 300 unique mosaic renderings that use the oculus - the eye - as the central symbol.  In their words, "Oculus was created to personalize and integrate the stations.  Eyes are both subtle and strong - they engage passing individuals, allowing for meditation or inviting dialogue."  The eyes are from the artists' photographs taken in New York , which were selected for the diversity of the  subjects' eyes.  An enormous central eye set in the floor, grounds the composition and serves as the centerpiece of a map of the world which radiates outward.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Nancy Holt's steel ceiling sculpture incorporating lighting at the Fulton Street/Broadway-Nassau subway station, is an example of Arts for Transit's early efforts to foster collaborations with station architects, (in this case, Lee Harris Pomeroy) to integrate the artwork with the architecture.   An environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars. *In {Astral Grating}, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  "The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus, and Piscus Austrinus," says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented. *{The plan for the new Fulton Street Transit Center, includes the reinstallation of Astral Grating  in the reconfigured passageways.}</art1_description>

		<art2_description>At the turn of the twentieth century the McAlpin Hotel was one of the places to be seen.  Frederick Dana Marsh created a series of twenty terra cotta murals for its walls, with maritime themes celebrating New York's important seaport.  Times change, and the hotel became apartments and the murals were removed.  In 2000, six of the murals were installed in the station and was the Marine Grill's famed ironwork entrance gate.  All of this blends well with the terra cotta plaques installed elsewhere in the system by the original builders of the subway. *{The rebuilding of the station, as part of the Fulton Street Transit Center, is underway and requires the murals' removal, restoration, and relocation.}</art2_description>

		<art1_description>Artist Harry Roseman created a bronze wall relief for the station that respects and highlights the underlying geology of the area while providing an experience for unsuspecting commuters.  As he described his work, "[This site] is underground, in the 'earth', under an urban setting...  Rocks are interspersed among tiles. The rocks in this situation could actually have been a part of the excavation process for the subway tunnel ... [and they] thus become a symbol for the process of building the tunnel and for being underground... The path and stairs as well as the tiles ... intermingle nature with the man-made. The built aspect of the stairs also alludes to the built environment, the city. The landscape could be the kind of place that was here before this was an urban center ...  The curve [of the tunnel] ... was also the perfect opportunity to twist the perspective of the staircase to reiterate the curve and suggest the going from one type of environment to another."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Clark Street Passage} is an intriguing artwork within the floor of the station that uses three geometric shapes - circles, squares, and triangles against a black background.  When transit customers walk down the passage they are exposed to all the configurations that can be made from these basic elements, which create a flowing sense of movement.  The study of constantly shifting geometric patterns is derived from artist Ray Ring's earlier work which was heavily influenced by early geometric abstract art from the early 20th century.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Porcelain enamel frieze on mezzanine walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{Work &amp; Nature} was inspired by the artist's interest in the Nevins Street station and its aesthetic history.  The artwork consists of porcelain enamel steel plates that use the same soft blue, green, and ochre tones as in the original mosaics, which are detailed with stenciled silhouettes printed in black - a woman operates a sewing machine, an architect reads a blueprint, a mother looks after a child, a man plants a tree, famed blues singer Furry Lewis plays the guitar, and a woman addresses a meeting.  The historic  mosaic patterns that ran along the station's walls were water damaged and on the brink of permanent loss.  Moved by the mosaics' plight, Anton van Dalen decided to preserve "the station's olden elegance and grand beauty" and, at the same time, to create a tribute to the people who use the station.  For the artist, these figures symbolize "the pride, dignity, and beauty surrounding all work."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The array of subway and rail lines at the Atlantic Avenue-Pacific Street and LIRR's Terminal presented a perfect opportunity for an "architect/artist" collaboration to unify passages and stairways, creating a coherent and efficient space.  George Trakas  uses forms and materials that underscore the structure and beauty of the cavernous space. *Trakas selected the stone pavers and bollards for the plaza area.  The architects designed a skylight for the historic station kiosk and Trakas added a small peephole equipped with a lens that provides a view from the street to the light-filled space below.  The viewer spies a boat-shaped gantry of stainless steel and mesh beneath the skylight.  A granite "wave" runs along the walls and crests at the point where the two stations, Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Street, meet - linking the passageways.  Referencing the names {Atlantic} and {Pacific}, the overarching concept is a place of landing and departure - functions shared by train stations and seaports.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The bronze and terra cotta art for this station references the triumphal Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch located above the Grand Army Plaza subway station,  which celebrates the Union army's victory in the Civil War.  Located opposite Brooklyn's Prospect Park, it is topped by a dramatic tableau of two Winged Victories, the ancient symbol of triumph, and four rearing horses leading a chariot carrying the figures of Columbia.  The arch is reflected Jane Greengold's {Wings for the IRT: The Irresistible Romance of Travel}.  Terra cotta bas relief mosaics of a Winged Victory appear at the base of each of the station's entrance staircases; three bronze Winged Victory plaques and a large terra cotta bas relief mosaic of two Victories leading a subway car also adorn the station.  Appropriately, the relief also alludes to the history of the subway system; the first logo for the Interboro Rapid Transit (IRT) was "{Flying Wheels}," a subway car with wings, and the artwork's title includes the initials of the IRT.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The Brooklyn Museum has long served as a repository for ornamental architectural forms salvaged from significant buildings that were being demolished.  Seventy-eight of these artifacts are installed in the Eastern Parkway/Brooklyn Museum subway station, enriching the environment and creating an introduction to the museum above.  Among these are plaques, lunettes, keystones, and other decorative elements that represent the city's architectural heritage.  The project is a successful example of institutional collaboration.  The Brooklyn Museum, working with MTA Arts for Transit and Vel Riberto Consulting, selected the artifacts and donated them to the project.  New mosaic designs were added, to frame the objects and to make connections with the architecture of the station.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>At the Botanic Garden station, community representatives, the station architectural team, and artist Millie Burns created a sensitive visual transition from street to mini-park surrounding the entrance and finally into the transit facility itself.  This is achieved by fences and railing designs.  The tall and wavy metal constructions echo both the trees and stately apartment buildings lining Eastern Parkway and harmonize with the modern lines of the station house.  Most importantly, they lead the way into the station and provide aesthetic uplift for transit users.  "The communities that border Eastern Parkway and the Botanic Garden are blessed with a rich natural bounty," Burns says.  "We are surrounded by trees, shrubs, plants, and vines.  The fences and railing designs are drawn from what I see in this neighborhood.  {IL7/Square} is about growth, a reaching toward the sun."</art1_description>

Home to many residents of Caribbean descent, the West Indian-American Day Parade is prominently featured alongside other neighborhood sights and scenes. "This neighborhood has had many different groups moving in and out over the years.  Now it's predominately Caribbean, and I wanted to freeze a moment in its history," says the artist.  In the section called "{Avenue of Churches}" Sunday morning rituals are observed while in "{The Neighborhood}," children are shown happily jumping rope on the area's sidewalks.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The ethereal {Flatbush Floogies}' forms in bronze reliefs are sprites or nymphs who frolic on plaques in the station's entry and on the train platform, accompanied by legends that describe the history of the neighborhood, from the native Canarsie tribe to pirate Captain Kidd to the Brooklyn Dodgers.  In the work, artist Muriel Castanis depicts absence by shaping flowing robes around bodies that are no longer there.  The haunting result suggests their loss.  To create her floating, hooded figures, Castanis "drapes" epoxy-saturated fabric, working it until satisfied with the shape, and letting it set until it hardens.  Then she casts the pieces in bronze for permanence.</art1_description>
