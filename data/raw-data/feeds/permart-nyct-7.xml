		<art1_description>Ik-Joong Kang's work expresses and celebrates Flushing, Queens, which is among the city's most ethnically diverse communities and home to a burgeoning Chinatown.  Composed of over 2,000 unique ceramic tiles, the mural shows community events, city views, family gatherings, people at work, and children at play.  "{Happy World} began when I was riding the subway every day.  I was fascinated by the different people and things I saw, so I took small canvases with me and began to create the images that became the work.  I hope these symbols... will make the tens of thousands of people who ride the 7 train every day talk about what they see and share their impressions."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Passage} was designed in tandem with the architects, FX + FOWLE, as an integral part of the station.  It features trapezoidal-shaped windows fitted into the steel so they can be opened and allow air into the platform.  The laminated, impact-resistant security glass is layered with a plasma composite material to break up light into the colors of the spectrum.  The artist has said that {Passage} is influenced by the markets, flowers, and colors on the nearby streets.  Tom Patti pioneered the integration of industrial and architectural glass into art.  "The ability of glass to occupy several physical states - transparent, opaque, dense, solid, weightless - all altering our spatial boundary - challenges me," he says.  All of {Passage}'s components were handmade in his studio.  This act of craftsmanship is critical, says Patti, to ensure the integrity of all elements.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Commuting/Community} reflects John Cavanagh's impressions of Woodside, a Queens neighborhood where railroad and subway lines intersect.  The two photo-montage murals are related to one another in revealing the daily life of Woodside's residents.  Both murals spell out "Woodside" using letters based on neighborhood sites. The murals reflect the contrasts present in this city neighborhood, from the rushing train overhead to the pleasant street life below.  In another scene, the artist juxtaposes children playing in the park with adults commuting into the city.  The portrayal of the community is offered to Woodside, in Cavanagh's words, "to provoke, stimulate, console, strengthen, and enjoy."</art1_description>

		<art2_description>{Woodside Continuum} deals with the history of Woodside as a neighborhood, and its relationship to the railroad in particular.  "The challenge and opportunity of the Woodside station is in its relationship to the past and to the future," Gerakaris explains.  "In designing art for it, I wanted to create a continuum to link generations  - starting centuries ago with wilderness, farms, country lanes, and abundant woods, to today.  People rushing by may become aware of this now vanished town and, upon reflection, realize that they are the link to the future ... I wanted {Woodside Continuum} to present history accurately but in an engaging way.  My aim was to encourage people to think about the continuity and to see the ways Woodside has changed and is changing - and the powerful role transportation has played in that process."</art2_description>

As parts of the building are enhanced by diamond-shaped tiles, so are the patterns on the optical panels based upon the diamond shape. The vibrancy of movement and the patterns in the panels create a visual dialogue between the Arts and Crafts style, the motion of the trains, and the high-tech world of today....  For the people who take the time to look, this installation becomes a moving exhibition."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The passageways and waiting areas of Grand Central's subway stations are like a bustling city, an underground community - but without a skyline.  This mosaic artwork brings architectural views down below. *Ferrara has long been interested in the simple and repetitive forms of building, and she uses forms that are simple and schematic, almost primitive-looking structures.  Taken together, they lend a unity and meditative character to the space; as people move through the platforms and passageways, the images seem to shift, and no two vistas are the same.  Ferrara thinks of these as pieces of a mathematical puzzle.  The spare simplicity and economy of design attracts viewers.  Nothing is casual or unintentional in the artist's design, which she describes: "This sequence of stripe/image is calculated.  It can be seen as images on a strip of film, or a line of faces framed in the windows of a passing train."</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Dan Sinclair's {Fast Track and Speedwheels} are assemblages crafted from bright metallic sections that include wavy aluminum sheets, steel wheels, brass disks, copper springs and wires.  Installed within a long passageway between the subway and Grand Central Terminal above, they interpret the speed, energy and train travel imagery into a series of relief sculptures.  The art-deco shapes and various turning wheels, spinning gears and pistons add to the aura of the location, below one of America's premiere rail stations.  "I want my sculpture to make people think of the power of the engines that drive the trains, the speed and efficiency of them . . . the sculptures also reflect the architectural elements of Times Square and the Art Deco glamour of Radio City Music Hall," says the artist.</art2_description>

		<art3_description>{V-Beam} is a functional structure and an aesthetic statement.  Artist Christopher Sproat has combined standard transportation hardware - signage, air circulation, and safety equipment - with his artistic sensibility to integrate the sculpture into the transit environment.  The artwork takes the form of a large V, which Sproat judged to be the most practical shape in terms of access and stability, and is equipped with extruded aluminum panels and light-emitting diodes to carry out its functions.  "Rather than make an artistic or decorative statement and add it to the station so that the viewer knows 'this is art,' I chose to make the entire space exuberant and unique," the artist says.</art3_description>

		<art1_description>One of the largest artworks in the MTA system runs under 42nd Street along the corridor connecting the B, D, F, V lines with the 7 train.  Above the site is the Main Library and Bryant Park, which are reflected in the artwork below.  On the walls of the tunnel we see rock outcroppings, tree roots, pipes, animal burrows, and literary quotations.  The artist based the project on the idea of systems.  In her words, "People travel the subway system, water and other utility services are delivered by pipes, and plants and trees that provide grace and softness against the city's sharper edges find their way to water and nutrients underground through a system of roots.  In a similar way, literature is shared by systems of learning and lending, and many animals inhabit systems of burrows just as humans systematically divide portions of larger habitats aboveground."  At the west end of the tunnel, color asserts itself in a frieze of rock and plant forms with a quote from psychologist Carl Jung:  "Nature must not win the game, but she cannot lose."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Times Square Mural} captures the spirit of the subway, its linear movement and dynamic energy.  With a nod to both the past and the future- its central image is a futuristic bullet shaped car zipping through an underground station.  And not just any station, this is Times Square, in the heart of New York City. *Lichtenstein was born in New York in 1923 and spent his last years here.  {Times Square Mural} reflects his career, with references to, and variations on, his earlier works.  Lichtenstein also freely appropriated and incorporated images from the works of other artists and designers in his work.  For instance, the hooded figure at the right of the mural is from the old Buck Rogers comic strips and the iconic 42 image is from a series of drawings of the architectural detail of the subway.  It is a signature work that honors its creator and the place in which it is located.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Jack Beal uses classical mythology to comment on the relationship between what is above and below the surface - an apt metaphor for the subway.  The work consists of two large mosaic panels that illustrate the mythological character Persephone.  Instead of fasting, she ate a pomegranate and as punishment, is banished underground for six months of the year.  However, she is permitted to spend six months above ground on earth with her mother.  In mythology, the periods above and below ground were the beginning of seasons, which Beal uses in his titles.  Beal finds universality in the myth and brings it to life in a place filled with movement and purpose, bringing beauty underground.</art2_description>

Whatever they are, chances are you will find it in {Times Square: 35 Times}, a series of artworks encased within glass blocks and set into the walls of the station.  Toby Buonagurio conceived the work around three themes emblematic of the energetic vibrancy of midtown Manhattan: performing arts, fashion, and street life - all recognizable to the everyday passerby and to the thousands of tourists who visit the city.  The ceramics are installed in illuminated shadowboxes throughout the Times Square subway station complex.</art3_description>

		<art4_description>The enormous mosaic mural is the focal point of the mezzanine in the Times Square subway complex.  Its shimmering and detailed surface pays tribute to the diversity and strength of New York City - its neighborhoods, cultural life, recreational pleasures, love of sports and, of course, its subway system.  {New York in Transit} was Jacob Lawrence's last public work.  In it he evokes city life seen from an elevated train and the sensitive and loving portrait shows a slice of city life and is a parting gift to New York City, seen by millions of people who live and visit here.</art4_description>

		<art5_material>Glass mosaic in lower mezzanine and 41st Street passageway between Port Authority and Times Square</art5_material>
		<art5_description>It's been said that if you stand long enough in Times Square, you will meet everyone you've ever known. Long known as the crossroads of the world, Times Square is famous for many things, but mostly for its crowds, particularly the spirited celebration each New Year's Eve when hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and visitors-joined by television viewers around the world, gather to watch the ball drop to usher in the New Year. Sharing hopes for the future, the huge crowds are televised against a neon background.  *In {The Revelers}, Jane Dickson celebrates this age-old impulse to gather. Her mosaic artwork consists of approximately 70 expressive life-size figures. Each is in motion, walking, gesturing, linking arms, or dancing; all enjoying themselves and each other's company. The central frieze of figures are presaged by a scattering of figures in groups of two or three walking in both directions along the corridors that lead to the central open space of the station complex, near the stairs to the 1, 2, 3 lines. These smaller groups share the space with commuters traveling through the passageways that connect the subway stations at Seventh and Eighth Avenues.</art5_description>

		<art1_date>1977-1992, 2002-present</art1_date>
		<art1_description>The work of art, {Times Square} is an invisible, deliberately unmarked area of sound at the north end of the pedestrian island at Broadway between 46th and 45th Streets. Conceived and originally installed by artist Max Neuhaus, it provides a rich harmonic sound texture that emerges from a large underground vault covered by a grating. *Commenting on artwork, Neuhaus has said, "For those who find and accept the work's anomaly, the island becomes a different place, separate, but including its surroundings. People, having no way of knowing that it has been deliberately made, usually claim the work as a place of their own discovering." *Installed by the artist in 1977, the artwork remained active until 1992, when Neuhaus moved abroad. In 2002 it was reinstated with the help of the Times Square Business Improvement District, MTA Arts for Transit, and the Dia Art Foundation, which will assume responsibility for its upkeep.</art1_description>
