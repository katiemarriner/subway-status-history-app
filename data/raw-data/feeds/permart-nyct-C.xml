		<art1_description>At Cathedral Parkway, Harlem's southern boundary, three large mosaic murals were created that refer to migration and African homelands.  "Overall, the panels present the ideas of uprooting, migration, and progress in symbolic form," says artist Christopher Wynter.  He further explains that the blocks of color differentiate various African ancestral homelands, and the circular symbol represents the {n'kis}, or sacred place concept, of the Nkongo people.  Houses on stilts suggest Central African buildings, while horizontal bands of color denote village paths.  Wheels and walking feet describe faraway destinations, according to Wynter, and reference the mass movements of Africans throughout history.  The station is located below Frederick Douglass Circle.  Douglass, the abolitionist crusader, is also depicted.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>In {For Want of a Nail}, the artist team used a variety of materials to suggest the range and diversity at the American Museum of Natural History, directly above the subway station.  Glass mosaic, glass tile, ceramic tile, granite, and bronze relief are combined in ways that highlight the ten key disciplines at the Museum. The mosaics represent extinct and living animals, the former in grey and the latter in color.  The work assembles images from outer space to the earth's core and from the first organisms to emerge to mammals of today.  The artwork was a collaboration between MTA Arts for Transit and the Museum.  {For Want of a Nail}, the title of an old proverb, asks the viewer to consider the way everything is connected.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>A monumental and vibrant porcelain tile wall drawing by Sol LeWitt has been installed at 59th Street-Columbus Circle. The artist created the proposal in 2004 and, working with Dattner Architects, selected the site in an expansive wall facing a double-wide stairway and landing that leads from the mezzanine to the platforms of the A, C, B, D and 1 trains. Titled {Whirls and twirls (MTA)}, the artwork is 53 feet wide and by 11 feet high and consists of 250 porcelain tiles in six colors, each cut to meet the artist's specifications. The artist created the drawing/maquette for the project, reviewed and selected materials, and approved color samples prior to his death in 2007. *The artist is known for his sculptures and his wall drawings, in which detailed directions are provided for the execution of the artwork in paint or pencil. The site-specific piece - unique because it is a permanent public installation of a wall drawing - is a bravura work of precision, with swooping curves and vertical and horizontal bars in vibrant color that completely fills the space. The tile was cut to the exact dimensions of the drawing to ensure that the scale of the work and the color sequences are as the artist intended. *Sol LeWitt (1928-2007) is a celebrated artist who has had hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries worldwide since 1965. His work includes more than 1,100 wall drawings, photographs, hundreds of works on paper, and geometry-based sculptures. An exhibition at Mass MOCA in North Adams, Massachusetts, features 105 wall drawings in a specially designed museum space and will be on view through 2033.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Artist Matt Mullican created an 8-foot by 68-foot sandblasted black granite mural that presents a time-line of the history of the station site, atop which sits an office tower.  (The subway station was rehabilitated in concert with the office development.)  Mullican employs an iconographic visual vocabulary through which he reveals the site's past as rural, occupied by a cabin, and as a previous site of Madison Square Garden.  Depictions of maps and aerial views are also part of the large mural.  Mullican's pictographs reward the repeat visitor with layers of meaning as the piece is viewed again and again.  Mullican communicates through a simplified visual system, but his signs provide deeper meaning to those who look.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Glass mosaics on mezzanine walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Lisa Dinhofer uses representations of toy marbles to challenge our imaginations by playing with illusions that alter physical perceptions.  Her work spans a 32-foot-long wall and two adjacent side walls.  Created in glass mosaic, the main artwork consists of a gold-colored trompe l'oeil frame surrounding a black and white tiled floor that serves as the backdrop for the marbles, which seem to roll toward the viewer. On the side walls, free-floating marbles seem to breaking free in space.  Dinhofer comments, "Every object I paint actually exists; I work from life.  The space I create is believable - but not real.  Because I design my own space, I call myself an 'illusionist' painter rather than a 'realist'.  The space in my work is invented.  It's flattened - like the space we see on a television or a computer screen."</art1_description>

		<art1_date>1977-1992, 2002-present</art1_date>
		<art1_description>The work of art, {Times Square} is an invisible, deliberately unmarked area of sound at the north end of the pedestrian island at Broadway between 46th and 45th Streets. Conceived and originally installed by artist Max Neuhaus, it provides a rich harmonic sound texture that emerges from a large underground vault covered by a grating. *Commenting on artwork, Neuhaus has said, "For those who find and accept the work's anomaly, the island becomes a different place, separate, but including its surroundings. People, having no way of knowing that it has been deliberately made, usually claim the work as a place of their own discovering." *Installed by the artist in 1977, the artwork remained active until 1992, when Neuhaus moved abroad. In 2002 it was reinstated with the help of the Times Square Business Improvement District, MTA Arts for Transit, and the Dia Art Foundation, which will assume responsibility for its upkeep.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Times Square Mural} captures the spirit of the subway, its linear movement and dynamic energy.  With a nod to both the past and the future- its central image is a futuristic bullet shaped car zipping through an underground station.  And not just any station, this is Times Square, in the heart of New York City. *Lichtenstein was born in New York in 1923 and spent his last years here.  {Times Square Mural} reflects his career, with references to, and variations on, his earlier works.  Lichtenstein also freely appropriated and incorporated images from the works of other artists and designers in his work.  For instance, the hooded figure at the right of the mural is from the old Buck Rogers comic strips and the iconic 42 image is from a series of drawings of the architectural detail of the subway.  It is a signature work that honors its creator and the place in which it is located.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Jack Beal uses classical mythology to comment on the relationship between what is above and below the surface - an apt metaphor for the subway.  The work consists of two large mosaic panels that illustrate the mythological character Persephone.  Instead of fasting, she ate a pomegranate and as punishment, is banished underground for six months of the year.  However, she is permitted to spend six months above ground on earth with her mother.  In mythology, the periods above and below ground were the beginning of seasons, which Beal uses in his titles.  Beal finds universality in the myth and brings it to life in a place filled with movement and purpose, bringing beauty underground.</art2_description>

		<art3_description>Think of Times Square and a variety of images, sights, sounds, and scents come to mind.  Whatever they are, chances are you will find it in {Times Square: 35 Times}, a series of artworks encased within glass blocks and set into the walls of the station.  Toby Buonagurio conceived the work around three themes emblematic of the energetic vibrancy of midtown Manhattan: performing arts, fashion, and street life - all recognizable to the everyday passerby and to the thousands of tourists who visit the city.  The ceramics are installed in illuminated shadowboxes throughout the Times Square subway station complex.</art3_description>

		<art5_description>It's been said that if you stand long enough in Times Square, you will meet everyone you've ever known. Long known as the crossroads of the world, Times Square is famous for many things, but mostly for its crowds, particularly the spirited celebration each New Year's Eve when hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and visitors-joined by television viewers around the world, gather to watch the ball drop to usher in the New Year. Sharing hopes for the future, the huge crowds are televised against a neon background.  *In {The Revelers}, Jane Dickson celebrates this age-old impulse to gather. Her mosaic artwork consists of approximately 70 expressive life-size figures. Each is in motion, walking, gesturing, linking arms, or dancing; all enjoying themselves and each other's company. The central frieze of figures are presaged by a scattering of figures in groups of two or three walking in both directions along the corridors that lead to the central open space of the station complex, near the stairs to the 1, 2, 3 lines. These smaller groups share the space with commuters traveling through the passageways that connect the subway stations at Seventh and Eighth Avenues.</art5_description>

		<art1_material>Glass mosaic throughout station</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{The Garden of Circus Delights} is the artist's homage to the circus, which makes annual visits to Madison Square Garden, located above the station, and also connected to the Long Island Rail Road.  Eric Fischl's work is narrative and this work follows in this tradition.  A series of murals takes commuters from the familiar to the bizarre circus world.  "I thought it would be amusing," Fischl says, "to do a contemporary Dante's Inferno, to turn commuting into a spiritual quest."  The murals portray fire-breathers, acrobats, and animals; gradually one realizes that a commuter has left home and been pulled into the circus, where he meets incredible circus characters and then, on the other side of the tent, he emerges in the white light and harmony, a commuter again, but transported and transformed."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The scores of figures created by Tom Otterness to {Life Underground} invigorate and transform the transit environment into a place of joy and whimsy.  *His small-scale sculptures invoke the subway and lore of the city and include an alligator rising out of a sewer to devour a man, workers carrying oversize versions of the tools used to build the subways, and people sneaking under fences to watch the construction or sweep up piles of pennies.  There are also colossal feet and a totem-like sculpture whose human features are formed into the shape of a telephone.  *Otterness placed his creations in unexpected places-beneath stairs and pillars, hanging from the ceiling, and on benches and railings-to surprise and delight riders as they come upon these humorous and captivating inhabitants.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Walter Martin and Paloma Mu&ntilde;oz have turned the Canal Street Station into a subterranean aviary.  There are dozens of birds - 174 grackles and blackbirds, in a number of different poses, and seven crows, all cast in bronze and given a glossy black patina.  They are seen roosting on railings and perched in groups, like people waiting for the train, watching, lost in thought, or chatting.  Birds, the artists note, are very social creatures - just like New Yorkers, and riders may find echoes of themselves and other subway riders in their lively expressions.  Canal Street is a busy commercial thoroughfare, devoid of nature.  {A Gathering} compensates for this by enlivening the space and providing respite from the dense traffic and bustling commercialism above.</art1_description>

Jones and Ginzel's work consists of over 300 unique mosaic renderings that use the oculus - the eye - as the central symbol.  In their words, &quot;Oculus was created to personalize and integrate the stations.  Eyes are both subtle and strong - they engage passing individuals, allowing for meditation or inviting dialogue.&quot;  The eyes are from the artists' photographs taken in New York , which were selected for the diversity of the  subjects' eyes.  An enormous central eye set in the floor, grounds the composition and serves as the centerpiece of a map of the world which radiates outward.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Nancy Holt's steel ceiling sculpture incorporating lighting at the Fulton Street/Broadway-Nassau subway station, is an example of Arts for Transit's early efforts to foster collaborations with station architects, (in this case, Lee Harris Pomeroy) to integrate the artwork with the architecture.   An environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars. *In {Astral Grating}, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  "The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus, and Piscus Austrinus," says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented. *{The plan for the new Fulton Street Transit Center, includes the reinstallation of Astral Grating  in the reconfigured passageways.}</art1_description>

		<art2_description>At the turn of the twentieth century the McAlpin Hotel was one of the places to be seen.  Frederick Dana Marsh created a series of twenty terra cotta murals for its walls, with maritime themes celebrating New York's important seaport.  Times change, and the hotel became apartments and the murals were removed.  In 2000, six of the murals were installed in the station and was the Marine Grill's famed ironwork entrance gate.  All of this blends well with the terra cotta plaques installed elsewhere in the system by the original builders of the subway. *{The rebuilding of the station, as part of the Fulton Street Transit Center, is underway and requires the murals' removal, restoration, and relocation.}</art2_description>

		<art1_description>The intricate play of nature is the theme of Ben Snead's mosaic and tile artwork, which fills the south mezzanine with bold color and intricate patterns along a specially designed 103 foot-long curved wall. The work exhibits the artist's interest in natural species and ways of arranging them in systems and patterns that highlight the connections and relationships between dissimilar species. *The artwork - created in glass mosaic based on Snead's original paintings - features species that have migrated to Brooklyn as well as one species that is departing.  He arranges the species in layers that can be seen from left to right: European starling (originally from England), a house sparrow (Europe), Red Lion fish (Indian Ocean), Monk parrot (South America) and Koi (Japan).  The Tiger Beetle is represented on a tile background; a local species that is in decline. The result is a bold and graphic set of images that intrigue and delight passersby during their own departures and arrivals.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>In {Life and Continued Growth}, Eric Pryor's 29 faceted glass windows use both traditional African and contemporary African American images.  Antelope horns signify movement and are a symbol for material prosperity.  Butterflies signify the life cycle, from gestation to birth to the change into adulthood.  The importance of music and rhythm are shown through African drums, a saxophone, and trumpets, rendered in vivid red, gold, and purple in contrast to the receding shades of green, blue and turquoise.  "The Franklin Avenue-Fulton Street area's rich African American heritage is being reborn," says Pryor. "Change and opportunity are arriving and the shuttle line both encourages and reflects how the community's new optimism.  {Life and Continued Growth} emerges from a spirit that is rooted in traditional African-American culture and the new energy that is making it soar again."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Dominating one of Jimmy James Greene's huge mosaic panels in the Utica Avenue station is a plump yellow angel on rollerblades.  Perhaps more than any image in the ten panels that compose {Children's Cathedral}, this demonstrates the artist's intentions:  to reflect the desires, dreams and memories of the community's children in their own drawings.  "At first," he says, "I talked with the kids about how they play, learn, pray, and celebrate.  Then they drew."  What emerged were images of the neighborhood: shops, a woman pushing a baby carriage, a teacher in class, plants, flowers, and, most of all, children in action: singing in choir, jumping rope, reading, riding bikes.  The artist took hundreds of the children's images and arranged them into eight groupings, adding color to the pencil drawings.  "They were the soloists," he says, "I was the orchestra leader."</art1_description>
