		<art1_description>The new MTA Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn features an artist/architect collaboration in a soaring, light-filled atrium. The project architects, di Domenico + Partners collaborated with the artists, Allan Wexler and Ellen Wexler, to create a special place of arrival in the entry pavilion which reaches from the street level down to the ticket office, waiting room and LIRR and NYC Transit subways. *The Wexlers created a two-story sculptural balcony and wall that visually evokes the adventure of travel. Titled {Overlook}, its rocky granite form cantilevers above the main concourse at the Terminal, referencing scenic overlooks often found in national parks, where travelers are encouraged to pause and take in the larger scene. The bands of granite also refer to nature found underground in layers of rock. Allan Wexler commented, "We sought to create the experience of viewing an urban public space as if it were a nature setting, using granite tiles mathematically pixilated to create nooks and crannies found in rock walls." Ellen Wexler said, "We wanted to create a space where one can stop and take in the dynamic energy, which is as exciting as stopping to take in the Grand Canyon or other major vista". *{Overlook} is framed by a pair of sweeping staircases and a glass and stainless steel balcony/railing that flows with the architecture of the space, which promises to be a Brooklyn landmark, akin to Grand Central Terminal's famous clock. *Allan Wexler and Ellen Wexler have created public art works nationwide, often using familiar forms imbued with new meanings and functions, fostering a new way of looking at or using the specific site. The materials used often are construction materials, as in the case of {Overlook}.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>In the {Morning Transit, Hempstead Plain &amp; Evening Transit, Hempstead Plain} murals, Roy Nicholson takes viewers back in time.  The area around Hicksville was once a notable rarity, an example of an original prairie landscape most often associated with the Midwest.  Nicholson recaptures that setting, in look and spirit, as if seen from a speeding train.  The colors vary according to the time of day depicted - soft green and blue hues for sunrise in {Morning Transit}, and red and blue hues for sunset in {Evening Transit}.  "Each commuter imagines his or her own personal scenery," says Nicholson.  "One can look at it over and over again and discover new images."  The artist creates a contemplative meditation on landscape and rewards the viewer with an affectionate look back at Long Island before the post-war housing boom forever altered the landscape.</art1_description>

		<art1_title>For My Grandfather Noye Pride, a Locomotive Engineer</art1_title>
		<art1_date>1998</art1_date>
		<art1_material>Faceted glass in windscreen</art1_material>
		<art1_description>At Huntington, Joe Zucker's 130-foot fantasy train chugs animatedly down the platform while serving as a windscreen.  Each faceted glass panel shows a cartoon-like flatcar hauling Long Island wares and sights, one to a car.  We see an oversized lobster, giant duck, jumbo potatoes, and a big bluefish.  Other images are the  Montauk lighthouse and a sailboat.  Zucker's fanciful images - the bluefish is green, the potato is blue - are rendered in faceted glass, equally powerful day and night.  Says Zucker; "I hope that this piece brings travelers enjoyment, that it gives them memories and of Long Island and moments of pleasure."  As the title indicates, members of the artist's family were employed on the railroad:  "It is in memory of my grandfather and uncles who served as engineers and firemen on the trains of a distant past."</art1_description>
