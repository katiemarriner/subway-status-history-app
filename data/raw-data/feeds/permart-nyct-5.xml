		<art1_description>In his portrayal of cityscapes with vast colorful skies full of energy and motion, Nicky Enright's faceted glass windows are a tribute to New York.  The artist created dramatic views with oversize skies, minimizing the size of buildings and city.  He plays on space and direction to create fragmented views, contracting the angles of the subway.  The scene shows a calm city under heavens filled with constellations, shooting stars, planets, moons and vibrant sunsets.  Through the artwork, Enright encourages commuters to contemplate, if only for a moment, the mystery and excitement of the city and its place in the universe.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>In {Bronx Literature}, B&eacute;atrice Coron celebrates the rich literary heritage of the area, and common activity for subway riders.  The Bronx has been the home and inspiration of numerous writers as diverse as Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, Sholem Aleichem, Allen Ginsberg, Chaim Potok, and Cynthia Ozick..  In particular, in {Bronx Literature} Coron portrays four great writers' works including Edgar Allan Poe's {Ulalume and other poems}; Sholem Aleichem's {Mottel, the Cantor's Son}; James Baldwin's {The Fire Next Time}; and Nicholasa Mohr's {El Bronx Remembered}.  The artist explains, "These authors tell the story of the borough from colonial times to suburban and contemporary community developments.  Their works help us travel through time into different social classes and communities, making each of us an insider."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The abstract patterns seen in Michele Brody's faceted glass art are based on subway lines that run from the Bronx through Manhattan to Brooklyn, as represented graphically on the MTA subway map.  In the first stage of the work, Brody extracted the red and green lines and transformed them through a process of extrapolating, twisting, turning, and layering them.  The final product, in faceted-glass, captivates the viewer's attention with interlocking streams of colors.  Fabricated into 20 panels and placed on the subway platform for viewing from inside as well as outside the station, the work is full of movement that reflects the motion of a subway train.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Tomie Arai's {Back to the Garden} consists of 24 faceted glass windows at Pelham Parkway in the Bronx.  The work contains seasonal floral imagery-spring blossoms, summertime wallflowers, and autumn foliage.  The species shown are common to the area of Pelham Parkway, which links Pelham Bay Park with the Bronx Zoo, and New York Botanical Garden.  Highlighting the historic nature of the station and the community, Arai insets historic black and white photographs into her colorful images.  The photos have been screened and fired onto the glass surface.  Taken from archival photographs, they span the period from 1899 to 1969 and capture views of the surrounding streets and buildings.  The artwork's title refers to lyrics in a Joni Mitchell song about returning to the simple life, the life back in the garden.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{B is for Birds in the Bronx}, a series of faceted glass windscreen panels, was inspired by the birds that populate the Bronx.  While they may often not be noticed, birds are present in our urban environment, filling the air with song and the sky with flight.  The artist makes the birds prominent through scale and composition, placing them in the foreground but almost treating them as negative space.  As the artist explains, "I wanted to subvert them by making them white, and make them invisible, large and regal.  The birds in their emptiness give attention to their transparency and how they hold a space for the trees, the bushes, the snow, the branches, the wind, the sky, and the leaves to exist, like a still-life painting...where the space outside of the object, really creates the form of the object... ."</art1_description>

The location of the work at the West Farms Square-East Tremont Avenue station is not coincidental; nearby is the world-famous Bronx Zoo.  The artist says that she considers {Animal Tracks} to be an integration of her past involvement in animal sciences with her art and "a step toward the unity and community feeling paramount to our steps in the future."  {Animal Tracks} serves as an introduction to the zoo to visitors just arriving at the station, and a reminder of the trip to those heading home.</art1_description>

En route, they pass  various neighborhoods, filled with color, pattern, and activity.  The artist also presents typical activities in which the community participates, such as a street festival, mask-making, and the planting of new trees.  Representations of flowers can be found in the station window niches, "simple reflections of nature that surrounds us," says the artist, Daniel Del Valle.  "Even though not everyone can take this magical trip up the river to view these sites, the 2 and 5 trains can provide people easy access to travel to these locations."</art1_description>

Artist Daniel Hauben a Bronx resident, has always been drawn to and inspired by the sense of scale provided by these immense structures when contrasted with their neighborhood settings, and his scenes, translated into faceted glass mosaics, depict the unique character of the Bronx through composition, pattern, light, darkness, and movement through the canvas. Hauben commented, that as one "looks down a long street topped by the receding concentric pattern of the elevated structure, one has a feeling of both great depth and the sprawling vastness of the city."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Urban Renewal} by Lisa Amowitz expresses the notion that structures, although built to last, are fragile entities, while flowers represent the eternal through renewal, rebirth, and rebuilding. For the artist, flowers help us embrace the beautiful mystery of life pulsing through every person in every building of the city. Flowers can be destroyed and still grow back to bloom another season. *This series of faceted glass panels depicts fallen buildings comforted by blooming flowers to signify New York's resilient spirit. It also represents the Bronx, continuously renewing itself and blooming with vibrancy in expected and unexpected places.

Light is a major theme of the piece, especially the burst of light that envelops a subway train when it leaves an underground tunnel and becomes elevated. African and Native American influences are integral to the work, as are arch shapes suggested by tunnels and 'els.'  Charged with energy, color, and music, reflecting myth and dance, these fulfill my wish to continue the tradition of mosaics in New York City's subway system."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Bronx. Four Seasons} is a series of faceted glass compositions illustrating the four seasons with views of the Bronx from the Prospect Avenue station.  The works by artist Marina Tsersarskaya feature the intricate and delicate design of the historic railings found in the station and depict an urban landscape of buildings, trees, and flowers, filtering the bright sunlight through the windows to create a transformed station environment that combines the city and nature into a single artistic vision.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Latin American Stories} at Jackson Avenue station in the Bronx turns the station into a land of fairytales from Latin American myth and folklore. *Installed in four windscreens and two sets of window niches on the north and south platforms, the faceted glass artwork is composed of six stories from different regions of Latin America. Colorful imagery on the southbound platform celebrates myths of rain, wind, and fire, including the Mayan myth "How Frogs Brought Rain to Mexico," the Andean legend of the Condor King, and the Brazilian myth of "How Fire Came to the Rain Forest." *On the northbound platform, images tell tales about love and creation, including "The King That Tried to Touch the Moon from the Lesser Antilles," the story of "The Beginning of the Sea" from the Greater Antilles, and a Latin American version of Cinderella. *Through the fluid rendering of the storylines in each panel, {Latin American Stories} is a picture book that reminds the diverse local community of these ancient stories and entices daily commuters to discover the universal beauty shared by every culture.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Jose Ortega created a series of mosaic panels  inspired by the busy circle of streets above the 149th Street station, referred to locally as "the Hub."  Ortega uses circular forms to invoke universal themes and creates recognizable imagery within an organic and abstract web of patterns.  "The circle is a powerful symbol," he says. "It connotes infinity, implies wholeness.  It has no beginning and no end."  His brightly colored murals focus on three circular images: "the sun as the provider of energy and the center of our universe, the earth as the sustainer of our humanly developed and natural worlds, and the face as the translator, both receptor and interpreter of the human and natural worlds."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{The {Open Secret}, a series of bronze reliefs mounted on the mezzanine level, was the first Arts for Transit commissioned work in the subway, and it presents many of artist Houston Conwill's longstanding thematic concerns: community, history, and the creation of sacred spaces as each relates to the African American experience and quest for equality. {The Open Secret} holds mysteries, and viewers can look inside at the objects within.  Two triangular sections serve as a time capsule of life in Harlem in the 1980s.  "The exploration might be of a place or into our own minds where we find eternal secrets that are saved and put in the time capsules for our children and their children," Conwill says.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Valerie Maynard's {Polyrhythmics of Consciousness and Light} was commissioned as part of a phase of renovation of the station that followed earlier work and the installation of {Open Secret }by Houston Conwill.  Maynard's work consists of glass mosaic murals along mezzanine and stairway walls that bring layers of pattern and color to an abstracted geometric field. Against the backgrounds are figural representations of musicians and others in joyful postures.  Maynard's images, in her words, "capture the boundless energy, the beacon of light that was and is our own homegrown Mecca: the Harlem of our dreams, our imaginings and our reality.  Maynard dedicates the work above the stairwells to artists, in recognition of their "flights of creativity."</art2_description>

		<art1_description>In {Happy City}, Peter Sis depicts four large eyes to represent the ingredients of the community and the vibrancy that is New York.  Created with etched stone and glass mosaics and rendered in bold color, above the stairs, the pupils and eyelashes are "drawn" with buildings from the neighborhood, incorporating such landmarks as the Metropolitan, Guggenheim, and Whitney museums, as well as Gracie Mansion.  The irises and whites of the eyes serve as a background for figurative elements that capture the diversity and energy of the community.  According to the artist, "The [people of the city] have children and want the best for their children, so they tell them stories and fairy tales.  The fairy tales are the magic animals which appear to float in throughout the four murals.  In the end they form the carousel with the happy children of all nationalities enjoying the ride.  That is the future of the city."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Riders at this station are treated to the joyous burst of color and shapes that is {Blooming}.   The mosaics defy the corners of the space as the imagery wraps around corners, down steps, and through doorways. *{Blooming} takes its title from Bloomingdale's, located above the station upstairs.  The artist views the subway as a "dreamy underworld" and also a place to wake up, and her pink trees, red shoes and yellow mugs with steaming coffee succeed in gaining the viewers' attention.  Murray says, "I added the stepping shoes and steaming coffee cups, part of the ritual of every morning or evening subway trip."  The images are intended to  "stimulate thoughts about passage, as does the poetry"  that is incorporated into the mural, lines from William Butler Yeats's, "In dreams begin responsibility,"  Gwendolyn Brooks's "Conduct your blooming in the noise and whip of the whirlwind."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The passageways and waiting areas of Grand Central's subway stations are like a bustling city, an underground community - but without a skyline.  This mosaic artwork brings architectural views down below. *Ferrara has long been interested in the simple and repetitive forms of building, and she uses forms that are simple and schematic, almost primitive-looking structures.  Taken together, they lend a unity and meditative character to the space; as people move through the platforms and passageways, the images seem to shift, and no two vistas are the same.  Ferrara thinks of these as pieces of a mathematical puzzle.  The spare simplicity and economy of design attracts viewers.  Nothing is casual or unintentional in the artist's design, which she describes: "This sequence of stripe/image is calculated.  It can be seen as images on a strip of film, or a line of faces framed in the windows of a passing train."</art1_description>

The art-deco shapes and various turning wheels, spinning gears and pistons add to the aura of the location, below one of America's premiere rail stations.  "I want my sculpture to make people think of the power of the engines that drive the trains, the speed and efficiency of them . . . the sculptures also reflect the architectural elements of Times Square and the Art Deco glamour of Radio City Music Hall," says the artist.</art2_description>

		<art3_description>{V-Beam} is a functional structure and an aesthetic statement.  Artist Christopher Sproat has combined standard transportation hardware - signage, air circulation, and safety equipment - with his artistic sensibility to integrate the sculpture into the transit environment.  The artwork takes the form of a large V, which Sproat judged to be the most practical shape in terms of access and stability, and is equipped with extruded aluminum panels and light-emitting diodes to carry out its functions.  "Rather than make an artistic or decorative statement and add it to the station so that the viewer knows 'this is art,' I chose to make the entire space exuberant and unique," the artist says.</art3_description>

		<art1_description>Mary Miss worked with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy to use the rehabilitation of Union Square station as an opportunity to uncover hidden structural elements, cables, and conduits - some still functional and others replaced by new improvements.  Old decorative work reappeared during construction, such as mosaics, pilasters, name plaques, and six terra cotta eagles from the 1904 station, once presumed lost. *Miss brings these treasures to the surface though a network of frames, windows, apertures, and mirrors. The bright red frames stand out; what they frame is more subtle - a bolt, a fragment of ancient-looking mosaic, a piece of rusted steel cable.  Other frames call attention to the station's historic name plaques.   "I'm inviting the public to look below the surface, to see a 'slice' of the station, its structure, its history, says the artist.  In this most public of places, the apertures offer an intimate engagement.  Looking in, you will see the station's workings - sometimes you will see layers of words and reflected images, including your own!"</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The Brooklyn Bridge's pioneering use of steel cables and a suspended roadway are repeatedly referenced in the design of artist Mark Gibian's work. Within the west mezzanine a web of cables recalls the graceful forms of the bridge, while overhead a 30-square foot structure, suspended beneath a skylight, frames the cable work.   At the turnstiles, three panels that also use cables serve as a functional barrier.   For the artist, the "lacy" curves of the panels "echo the beauty of the bridge's cross-hatched cables and the feeling of flight as it springs across the East River."  The energy of {Cable Crossing} suggests "the controlled power of the subway and its network of metal and concrete that undergirds the city.   I wanted to explore movement, using soft curves with hard materials," Gibian says.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Nancy Holt's steel ceiling sculpture incorporating lighting at the Fulton Street/Broadway-Nassau subway station, is an example of Arts for Transit's early efforts to foster collaborations with station architects, (in this case, Lee Harris Pomeroy) to integrate the artwork with the architecture.   An environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars. *In {Astral Grating}, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  "The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus, and Piscus Austrinus," says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented. *{The plan for the new Fulton Street Transit Center, includes the reinstallation of Astral Grating  in the reconfigured passageways.}</art1_description>

		<art2_material>Glazed terracotta murals and painted cast iron gates created for the McAlpin Hotel in 1913; reinstalled in passageway;  to be relocated to the new Williams Street entrance to the A, C, 2, 3 as part of the Fulton Street Transit Center project.</art2_material>
		<art2_description>At the turn of the twentieth century the McAlpin Hotel was one of the places to be seen.  Frederick Dana Marsh created a series of twenty terra cotta murals for its walls, with maritime themes celebrating New York's important seaport.  Times change, and the hotel became apartments and the murals were removed.  In 2000, six of the murals were installed in the station and was the Marine Grill's famed ironwork entrance gate.  All of this blends well with the terra cotta plaques installed elsewhere in the system by the original builders of the subway. *{The rebuilding of the station, as part of the Fulton Street Transit Center, is underway and requires the murals' removal, restoration, and relocation.}</art2_description>

		<art1_material>Porcelain enamel frieze on mezzanine walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{Work &amp; Nature} was inspired by the artist's interest in the Nevins Street station and its aesthetic history.  The artwork consists of porcelain enamel steel plates that use the same soft blue, green, and ochre tones as in the original mosaics, which are detailed with stenciled silhouettes printed in black - a woman operates a sewing machine, an architect reads a blueprint, a mother looks after a child, a man plants a tree, famed blues singer Furry Lewis plays the guitar, and a woman addresses a meeting.  The historic  mosaic patterns that ran along the station's walls were water damaged and on the brink of permanent loss.  Moved by the mosaics' plight, Anton van Dalen decided to preserve "the station's olden elegance and grand beauty" and, at the same time, to create a tribute to the people who use the station.  For the artist, these figures symbolize "the pride, dignity, and beauty surrounding all work."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The array of subway and rail lines at the Atlantic Avenue-Pacific Street and LIRR's Terminal presented a perfect opportunity for an "architect/artist" collaboration to unify passages and stairways, creating a coherent and efficient space.  George Trakas  uses forms and materials that underscore the structure and beauty of the cavernous space. *Trakas selected the stone pavers and bollards for the plaza area.  The architects designed a skylight for the historic station kiosk and Trakas added a small peephole equipped with a lens that provides a view from the street to the light-filled space below.  The viewer spies a boat-shaped gantry of stainless steel and mesh beneath the skylight.  A granite "wave" runs along the walls and crests at the point where the two stations, Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Street, meet - linking the passageways.  Referencing the names {Atlantic} and {Pacific}, the overarching concept is a place of landing and departure - functions shared by train stations and seaports.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>At the Botanic Garden station, community representatives, the station architectural team, and artist Millie Burns created a sensitive visual transition from street to mini-park surrounding the entrance and finally into the transit facility itself.  This is achieved by fences and railing designs.  The tall and wavy metal constructions echo both the trees and stately apartment buildings lining Eastern Parkway and harmonize with the modern lines of the station house.  Most importantly, they lead the way into the station and provide aesthetic uplift for transit users.  "The communities that border Eastern Parkway and the Botanic Garden are blessed with a rich natural bounty," Burns says.  "We are surrounded by trees, shrubs, plants, and vines.  The fences and railing designs are drawn from what I see in this neighborhood.  {IL7/Square} is about growth, a reaching toward the sun."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The series of glass mosaics, created by artist Louis Delsarte, reflect the color, energy, and daily life in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn where the station is located.  Home to many residents of Caribbean descent, the West Indian-American Day Parade is prominently featured alongside other neighborhood sights and scenes. "This neighborhood has had many different groups moving in and out over the years.  Now it's predominately Caribbean, and I wanted to freeze a moment in its history," says the artist.  In the section called "{Avenue of Churches}" Sunday morning rituals are observed while in "{The Neighborhood}," children are shown happily jumping rope on the area's sidewalks.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The ethereal {Flatbush Floogies}' forms in bronze reliefs are sprites or nymphs who frolic on plaques in the station's entry and on the train platform, accompanied by legends that describe the history of the neighborhood, from the native Canarsie tribe to pirate Captain Kidd to the Brooklyn Dodgers.  In the work, artist Muriel Castanis depicts absence by shaping flowing robes around bodies that are no longer there.  The haunting result suggests their loss.  To create her floating, hooded figures, Castanis "drapes" epoxy-saturated fabric, working it until satisfied with the shape, and letting it set until it hardens.  Then she casts the pieces in bronze for permanence.</art1_description>
