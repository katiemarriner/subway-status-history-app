		<art1_description>Inspired by the architectural design of the station, artist Michael Ingui sought to capture its energy through {Crescendo}.  The brilliant green and blue colors are used to accentuate the geometry and directional quality of the structure--emphasizing the station's structural elements--and to unify the different events on the panels to create a single vision.  The lines of the glass panels are in continuous motion--just like the trains and passengers that travel by them every day.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Fused glass in platform windscreens</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Using windows as a motif, artist Eugenie Tung looks into the daily lives of New Yorkers engaged in their daily routines before (on the Manhattan-bound platform) and after (on the Brooklyn-bound platform) their daily commutes: watering plants, watching TV, eating breakfast, cooking dinner.  The artist believes that beauty can be found within these often overlooked ordinary activities; although there may be differences in how they are carried out, the rituals of daily life cross invisible boundaries and unite us all through the concept of home.</art1_description>

The 18 colorful, painterly glass works highlight shared experiences of the changing seasons.  Williamson strove to capture expressions of timelessness and bring light and peace to the station environment, inspiring riders' thoughts and memories of places they have been and the joyful start of each new day.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Rainbows, butterflies, sunny skies, and shining stars are incorporated into {The Habitat for the Yellow Bird}.  In fabricating the 18 faceted glass panels located on the platforms of the Sutter Avenue station, the artist took great care to include details of her original artwork such as painting minuscule veins and features of the leaves as part of vibrant compositions of flowers, over 100 tiny pieces of glass to portray the brilliance of a single butterfly, subtle shading of the petals of the bold sunflower, and a carefully selected color palette for the delicate field of pansies.  Takayo strove to bring cheer and spirit to the transit public through her colorful imaginary landscapes with blue skies and twinkling stars.

		<art1_material>Faceted glass throughout complex; glass mosaic on upper mezzanine wall</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{Brooklyn, New Morning} is an expansive work that consists of 75 unique glass panels, arranged into a series of panels throughout the complex and also features a seven-by-ten-foot glass mosaic mural wall. *Al Loving said the work has a &quot;spirit of interdependence and interconnection as an important aspect of the American experience,&quot; reflecting that this large station serves as a crossroads.  Working with natural light, he achieves a lively and engaging atmosphere, and the colored light and flowing forms create a sense of optimism and well-being.  Loving enjoyed a long career, earning critical attention for his exploration of form and the properties of bright and bold colors.   The dynamic energy that infuses his work, shines through in {Brooklyn, New Morning}, this time in glass and glass mosaic. Loving died in 2005.</art1_description>

The imagery fills the overhead circular ceiling, providing the viewer with a joyful visual escape at this busy transit hub.  Within the center, the view is reversed and we see a birds-eye map view of the city within an "oculus".  The location of the station is pinpointed, surrounded by the vastness of New York City.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Constructed of glass and ceramic tile, Jackie Chang's {Signs of Life} offers text and images arranged as a puzzle throughout the station.  A rock sits atop a pointed shape between two words, "FAITH" and "FATE."  Other words -- "MAN," "KIND," "IT," "SELF" - are in the path of a cresting wave below.  The artist seeks to spark the viewers' imaginations, perhaps hoping that interpretations will emerge over repeated viewings and rumination.  The tone of the messages are enigmatic:  are they optimistic or pessimistic; are they speaking of the past or to the future?   "I kept my titles brief," Chang says.  "I wanted them to be challenging."  In a sense, these bits of what Chang calls "urban poetry" are an acknowledgment of the creative energy flowing through the community.</art1_description>

		<art1_date>1998</art1_date>
		<art1_material>Glass, enameled steel, and aluminum frames highlighting historic and architectural elements throughout station complex</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Mary Miss worked with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy to use the rehabilitation of Union Square station as an opportunity to uncover hidden structural elements, cables, and conduits - some still functional and others replaced by new improvements.  Old decorative work reappeared during construction, such as mosaics, pilasters, name plaques, and six terra cotta eagles from the 1904 station, once presumed lost. *Miss brings these treasures to the surface though a network of frames, windows, apertures, and mirrors. The bright red frames stand out; what they frame is more subtle - a bolt, a fragment of ancient-looking mosaic, a piece of rusted steel cable.  Other frames call attention to the station's historic name plaques.   "I'm inviting the public to look below the surface, to see a 'slice' of the station, its structure, its history, says the artist.  In this most public of places, the apertures offer an intimate engagement.  Looking in, you will see the station's workings - sometimes you will see layers of words and reflected images, including your own!"</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The scores of figures created by Tom Otterness to {Life Underground} invigorate and transform the transit environment into a place of joy and whimsy.  *His small-scale sculptures invoke the subway and lore of the city and include an alligator rising out of a sewer to devour a man, workers carrying oversize versions of the tools used to build the subways, and people sneaking under fences to watch the construction or sweep up piles of pennies.  There are also colossal feet and a totem-like sculpture whose human features are formed into the shape of a telephone.  *Otterness placed his creations in unexpected places-beneath stairs and pillars, hanging from the ceiling, and on benches and railings-to surprise and delight riders as they come upon these humorous and captivating inhabitants.</art1_description>
