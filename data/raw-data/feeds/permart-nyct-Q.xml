		<art1_description>{Carnegie Hall Montage} is a colorful arrangement of images in porcelain on steel that shows the range of artists who have performed on the world-renowned stage.  Some depict Carnegie Hall's classical pedigree, such as Leonard Bernstein and Marian Anderson, for example, while others portray the Beatles, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Eleanor Roosevelt, as testament to the importance of the stage.  Nearby, hundreds of white tiles with text commemorate the names, professions, and appearance date of notables who graced Carnegie's stage.  In the words of Carnegie Hall activist Gino Francesconi:  "I have always felt that the subway station directly below Carnegie Hall should reflect the history of the building just as the subways of Moscow and Paris do their own cultural institutions ... It reminds one of the connection between the city and its art."</art1_description>

		<art1_date>1977-1992, 2002-present</art1_date>
		<art1_description>The work of art, {Times Square} is an invisible, deliberately unmarked area of sound at the north end of the pedestrian island at Broadway between 46th and 45th Streets. Conceived and originally installed by artist Max Neuhaus, it provides a rich harmonic sound texture that emerges from a large underground vault covered by a grating. *Commenting on artwork, Neuhaus has said, "For those who find and accept the work's anomaly, the island becomes a different place, separate, but including its surroundings. People, having no way of knowing that it has been deliberately made, usually claim the work as a place of their own discovering." *Installed by the artist in 1977, the artwork remained active until 1992, when Neuhaus moved abroad. In 2002 it was reinstated with the help of the Times Square Business Improvement District, MTA Arts for Transit, and the Dia Art Foundation, which will assume responsibility for its upkeep.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Times Square Mural} captures the spirit of the subway, its linear movement and dynamic energy.  With a nod to both the past and the future- its central image is a futuristic bullet shaped car zipping through an underground station.  And not just any station, this is Times Square, in the heart of New York City. *Lichtenstein was born in New York in 1923 and spent his last years here.  {Times Square Mural} reflects his career, with references to, and variations on, his earlier works.  Lichtenstein also freely appropriated and incorporated images from the works of other artists and designers in his work.  For instance, the hooded figure at the right of the mural is from the old Buck Rogers comic strips and the iconic 42 image is from a series of drawings of the architectural detail of the subway.  It is a signature work that honors its creator and the place in which it is located.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Jack Beal uses classical mythology to comment on the relationship between what is above and below the surface - an apt metaphor for the subway.  The work consists of two large mosaic panels that illustrate the mythological character Persephone.  Instead of fasting, she ate a pomegranate and as punishment, is banished underground for six months of the year.  However, she is permitted to spend six months above ground on earth with her mother.  In mythology, the periods above and below ground were the beginning of seasons, which Beal uses in his titles.  Beal finds universality in the myth and brings it to life in a place filled with movement and purpose, bringing beauty underground.</art2_description>

		<art3_description>Think of Times Square and a variety of images, sights, sounds, and scents come to mind.  Whatever they are, chances are you will find it in {Times Square: 35 Times}, a series of artworks encased within glass blocks and set into the walls of the station.  Toby Buonagurio conceived the work around three themes emblematic of the energetic vibrancy of midtown Manhattan: performing arts, fashion, and street life - all recognizable to the everyday passerby and to the thousands of tourists who visit the city.  The ceramics are installed in illuminated shadowboxes throughout the Times Square subway station complex.</art3_description>

Its shimmering and detailed surface pays tribute to the diversity and strength of New York City - its neighborhoods, cultural life, recreational pleasures, love of sports and, of course, its subway system.  {New York in Transit} was Jacob Lawrence's last public work.  In it he evokes city life seen from an elevated train and the sensitive and loving portrait shows a slice of city life and is a parting gift to New York City, seen by millions of people who live and visit here.</art4_description>

		<art5_description>It's been said that if you stand long enough in Times Square, you will meet everyone you've ever known. Long known as the crossroads of the world, Times Square is famous for many things, but mostly for its crowds, particularly the spirited celebration each New Year's Eve when hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and visitors-joined by television viewers around the world, gather to watch the ball drop to usher in the New Year. Sharing hopes for the future, the huge crowds are televised against a neon background.  *In {The Revelers}, Jane Dickson celebrates this age-old impulse to gather. Her mosaic artwork consists of approximately 70 expressive life-size figures. Each is in motion, walking, gesturing, linking arms, or dancing; all enjoying themselves and each other's company. The central frieze of figures are presaged by a scattering of figures in groups of two or three walking in both directions along the corridors that lead to the central open space of the station complex, near the stairs to the 1, 2, 3 lines. These smaller groups share the space with commuters traveling through the passageways that connect the subway stations at Seventh and Eighth Avenues.</art5_description>

		<art1_description>Michele Oka Doner's {Radiant Site}, at the busy 34th Street-Herald Square subway station, fills a rectilinear floor-to-ceiling passage with golden light.  The midsection of the corridor is the brightest, glazed in copper-toned tiles; the tiles grow darker and reflect less light along the top and bottom of the passageway.  The result is a gently glowing surface.  The artist made the 11,000 tiles one-by-one by hand on a century-old foot-press at the venerable Pewabic Pottery in Detroit.  Their slightly irregular shapes and uneven surfaces were then hand-glazed, varying the recipe in tiny increments so as to achieve the desired luminosity.  Doner says that she considers not only the physical and chemical properties of the materials she will use but also "their psychic and cosmic qualities."</art1_description>

		<art2_date>1996</art2_date>
		<art2_description>A green painted rectangular structure is suspended from the subway platform and engages travelers with its ability to produce sounds.  Travelers place their hands in front of the box-like apparatus on the subway platform and a burst of musical notes are released on the opposite side, playing to the person on the other side.  The hand motions elicit an outpouring of sounds that evoke urban life and bring about duets between strangers waiting for their respective trains.  Artist Christopher Janney creates sound sculptures and public art that use sound and motion.  This work brings about interaction and pleased participants, serving in Janney's words, as "a foil for getting total strangers to interact with each other."</art2_description>

		<art3_description>In the 34th Street-Herald Square subway station riders are met by large, luminous orbs that seem to hover in space.  Made of coiled aluminum rods - formed in a manner similar to the way in which ceramicists build pots from clay - the spheres are suspended on a framework of small beams from the larger steel structural components of the station.  {Halo} contrasts the aesthetic with the utilitarian and the result is "an unexpected serenity."  The artist say, "It was my aim to create an enigmatic distribution of objects that would stand in sharp contrast to the rectilinear nature of the site, and in doing so, to establish an oasis of visual language amid an otherwise functional environment."</art3_description>

		<art4_description>A series of red wind paddles, each 12 long, hangs between the east wall of the station and each of the 14 columns that run the length of the wall.  The artist's concept was for the delicately balanced paddles to spin and flutter in the wind generated by approaching and departing trains.  From the artist's proposal:  "As every veteran subway rider knows - whether actively or intuitively - the approach of a train is preceded by a gust of wind funneling down the track. It's my interest to build and install a series of subway 'wind paddles' that will utilize and make visible these subterranean breezes.  The varying amounts of wind will set the brightly colored paddles floating, tilting, and spinning in descriptive patterns."</art4_description>

		<art1_material>Glass, enameled steel, and aluminum frames highlighting historic and architectural elements throughout station complex</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Mary Miss worked with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy to use the rehabilitation of Union Square station as an opportunity to uncover hidden structural elements, cables, and conduits - some still functional and others replaced by new improvements.  Old decorative work reappeared during construction, such as mosaics, pilasters, name plaques, and six terra cotta eagles from the 1904 station, once presumed lost. *Miss brings these treasures to the surface though a network of frames, windows, apertures, and mirrors. The bright red frames stand out; what they frame is more subtle - a bolt, a fragment of ancient-looking mosaic, a piece of rusted steel cable.  Other frames call attention to the station's historic name plaques.   "I'm inviting the public to look below the surface, to see a 'slice' of the station, its structure, its history, says the artist.  In this most public of places, the apertures offer an intimate engagement.  Looking in, you will see the station's workings - sometimes you will see layers of words and reflected images, including your own!"</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Bing Lee's {Empress Voyage} commemorates the pioneering expedition of the American merchant ship, Empress of China, which in 1794 returned to New York harbor filled with silk, tea, and porcelain (commonly called china, due to its origin).  Through the artist's lighthearted use of Chinese-derived icons, the tiles illustrate aspects of the then-new trade with Asia and celebrates today's Chinatown.  On the platforms, interlocking teapots incorporate the Chinese symbol for "good life."  Other symbols, on the station's upper level, are variations on the symbols for "Asia," "quality," and "cycle."  As trains arrive, debarking passengers are given a choice of reading "Canal Street" in English or the Chinese characters for "Chinatown." "I want to give the viewers art that reminds them of history, but also speaks directly to them," says Lee, "something meaningful but also playful."</art1_description>

On the surface, the variety of colors and shapes in the mosaics resemble collages and invite the traveler to consider the multiple layers of images found on city walls, particularly in the subway, where posters may tear, revealing previous images and forming exciting compositions....The glass is as diverse as the station's passengers, whose ethnic origins stem from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. ... I wanted the abstract design to be balanced with realistic images that people can instantly get."  The work brings vibrancy and texture to the station environment.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>A disarmingly simple artwork, placed in the unused subway station at Myrtle Avenue in 1980, has been restored. {Masstransiscope} turns the subway into a movie machine, presenting a colorful, animated "moving picture" to commuters as the train moves through the tunnel. With heavy cleaning by volunteers, the artwork became visible again in 2008. *The artwork has been viewed by millions of commuters from subway cars leaving the northbound platform of the DeKalb Avenue station on the express track. The 228 hand-painted panels are viewed through a series of vertical slits set into a specially constructed housing that runs the full 300' length of the old station. The piece works on the principle of the Zoetrope, a 19th century optical toy. *The movement of the train passing in front of the exhibition creates the illusion of a 20-second animated movie. In a regular movie the film passes through a projector to create an illusion of motion and the audience sits still. With {Masstransiscope} it is the audience that moves while the film stays in place.</art2_description>

		<art1_description>The array of subway and rail lines at the Atlantic Avenue-Pacific Street and LIRR's Terminal presented a perfect opportunity for an "architect/artist" collaboration to unify passages and stairways, creating a coherent and efficient space.  George Trakas  uses forms and materials that underscore the structure and beauty of the cavernous space. *Trakas selected the stone pavers and bollards for the plaza area.  The architects designed a skylight for the historic station kiosk and Trakas added a small peephole equipped with a lens that provides a view from the street to the light-filled space below.  The viewer spies a boat-shaped gantry of stainless steel and mesh beneath the skylight.  A granite "wave" runs along the walls and crests at the point where the two stations, Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Street, meet - linking the passageways.  Referencing the names {Atlantic} and {Pacific}, the overarching concept is a place of landing and departure - functions shared by train stations and seaports.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Garden Stops} brings neighborhood gardens and their creeping vines into the historic station architecture.  Patsy Norvell's steel railings enclose the station entrances and stairwells leading down to the tracks, and each has a floral motif.  Curving steel bars give way to columns topped by abstract flower designs.  The railings' vertical bars are punctuated by decorative squares, reproduced from the stations' original fencing.  In the waiting rooms large tri-panel bay windows that are etched with floral imagery overlook the tracks, mediating between the indoor and outdoor space.  The artist describes the work as "an environment that surrounds you rather than something you stop to look at.  As viewers pass through, the work's elements evoke the history of the stations, trigger people's own memories, and spark a kind of inner dialogue about space, nature, and change."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>David Wilson's skylight fills the waiting area of this Brooklyn subway station with bright, clear light.  The panels are framed in blue and the pattern in the panes consists of black lines and solid panels in geometric form, that echoes the aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts movement and leaded glass work from that era, but with a more contemporary interpretation.  In Wilson's words, "I had been interested in the use of plastics and the possibility of "leadlines" that are not feasible in glass - thus the diagonal "cuts" going to nowhere in the piece (i.e. stopping in the middle of a color).  The project is a kind of architectural statement - a skylight set into a difficult environment (a steel I-beam divides the triangular window into two halves so that it is hard to read as a whole)."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>At the turn of the twentieth century Sheepshead Bay was a popular tourist destination.  Historic sites and views from its past are portrayed in {Postcards from Sheepshead Bay}.  The large mural outdoors is an oversized replica of a vintage postcard that nostalgically shows a couple fishing, a jockey on horseback, and a summer home - as well as a sheepshead, the fish for which the village was named. DeBorah Goletz fancifully cut out the couples' faces, allowing people to "stick their heads through for souvenir photos, just like the old boardwalk props," she says.  Inside, another mural of turn-of-the-century people, and two smaller ones, capture quiet moments on the bay.  Goletz created intricately patterned tiles with color gradations from green to blue and back to green.  The results are rhythmic patterns that make one "feel" the water itself.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Brighton Beach, near Coney Island, was once one of New York City's prime seaside entertainment and recreation areas.  "The sea is ancient, rich, and mysterious," says Dan George.  "I wanted {Dionysus} to intrigue people and to remind them of the sea's mythic history and thereby spark the creation of their own dreams and fantasies."  Dolphins - six pairs and a singleton - are used by the artist to depict the metamorphosis from human to animal.  These have a light and supple appearance, belying the materials from which they are made - sturdy, solid and durable aluminum plate and the way that natural light reflects off the water plays on the satiny polished finish and planes of the sculptures giving it buoyancy.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The inspiration for the station's design was local sites - the historic Coney Island boardwalk and Cyclone roller coaster, the aquarium next to the station, and area beaches.  The station is on the approximate site of a former roller coaster ride.  The architect, Jim McConnell of Daniel Frankfurt, wanted to transform the exterior station walls in a unique way.  Working with the architects, artist Vito Acconci developed an architectural treatment for the station fa&ccedil;ade that is full of life.  As in successful collaborations, there is no clear delineation between the architecture and the art. *Before rehabilitation, the windscreens blocked ocean views; the new windscreens open up the platform view of the Atlantic Ocean.   In the artist's words, "The normally horizontal and vertical steel windscreen tubes and panels have been transformed into a more sinuous form that evokes the notion of a wave, or that of motion as in the Cyclone or the subway itself."  The result is a striking and unique subway station that fits into its special surroundings.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{My Coney Island Baby} at the Stillwell Avenue subway terminal is big, bold, and attention-grabbing.  Images are silk-screened onto glass bricks that form a Vista glass-brick wall.  In the artist's words, "I see a glass wall built as a celebration of life and joy containing all sorts of different images relating to the history of one of the greatest landmarks in the city, Coney Island."  The popular image of Coney Island is the amusement park and beach, but the neighborhood is also solidly residential.  {My Coney Island Baby} focuses on this variety, featuring the recreational attractions as well as the people who live, work, and play here.  As light conditions change {My Coney Island Baby} does as well.  In daylight, with the sun streaming in, its images and colors are boldly illuminated.  At night it glows from within, adding mystery to the surroundings.  Wilson is internationally known for his work in experimental theater and here he brings his visionary stagecraft to public art with great effect.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>With the renovation of the Stillwell Avenue Coney Island Terminal, a new building was constructed, with a retail arcade along the passage to the trains.  Architects Di Domenico   Partners, refer to it as "a collage of elements that recall the 'Playland' character of Coney Island's past and strike the spark that will shape the area's future." Vel Riberto Consulting and Fisher Marantz Renfro Stone were instrumental in the lighting of the project; it evokes the original Coney Island amusements, including Steeplechase Park, and Luna Park.  While most of the building is new, important historic elements from the earlier structure were  preserved.  Here, Arts for Transit led the efforts to conserve and reintroduce rather than replace the parapet from the original building along with 'BMT Lines" medallion and BMT logo in green and red glazes.  Conservator Alan Farancz preserved these historic elements. *{Arts for Transit's mission includes maintaining historic elements when they can be integrated into rehabilitation, thereby linking the old with the new.}</art2_description>
