		<art1_description>Andrew Leicester's {Ghost Series} consists of five monumental bas-relief terra cotta murals installed throughout the Long Island Rail Road station. The pieces evoke the building's illustrious predecessor, the 1910 Pennsylvania Station building by McKim, Mead and White that was demolished in 1963, an event that triggering the historic preservation movement.  Fragments of the old Penn Station are hidden in the lower depths of the building that replaced it, and the murals symbolically reveal the old building now hidden behind new walls. *In {Day and Night}, a 500-square-foot-mural in the main concourse, Leicester reinterprets Adolph Wineman's sculpture of the same name that presided over the old station's entrances, depicting two women flanking a gigantic clock.  The artist embedded the date the original building was demolished - 10/28/63 - into the clock's blank face.  Other murals include Mercury Man, a reproduction of another sculptural figure, and a porcelain-on-steel rendering of blueprints for the demolished building.  Taken together, {Ghost Series} is a compelling memento mori - a reminder that we are mortal.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>In {Eclipsed Time} Maya Lin tries to get commuters to think differently about time and trains.  "I'm asking for a one-on-one relationship between the viewer and the work," the artist says.  The large metal sculpture, installed overhead in the Long Island Rail Road's main concourse at Penn Station, combines industrial craftsmanship with contemporary technology to tell time.  "When people think about clocks they usually envision hands or digital numbers," explains Lin. "Time is measured mathematically and specifically.  I wanted to reflect time naturally and chose to use the concept of an eclipse."  To create this effect, a solid disk hangs between the light source and a stationary glass disk.  Light shines through the glass disk, illuminating the rotunda below.  The solid disk travels from east to west and back.  An eclipse is created at midnight, as the two disks are aligned and only a penumbra of light shines around the aligned circles.  The cycle is repeated daily.</art2_description>
