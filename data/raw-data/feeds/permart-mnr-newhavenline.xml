		<art1_material>Faceted glass in platform windscreen</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{Tranquility}'s 12 faceted glass windscreen panels at the Mount Vernon station convey the shimmering quality of Impressionism in stained glass.  The artwork creates the atmosphere of the country through her imagery and color palette, brightening the commuter rail station.  As its title implies, the work is calming in its depiction of a natural environment with a grove of trees, a lake, and sky, in shades of green, blue, and yellow.  Artist Marjorie Blackwell wanted "the colors and how they are shaped and dance across the windscreen" to give commuters "something to play with, meditate with, and connect with at the station."</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Mosaic mural on station waiting room wall</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{The Four Seasons} mosaic mural shows the passing seasons in suburban Larchmont through a study of local plant forms.  The work brings lushness and soft color to the waiting room, providing an inviting atmosphere.  In the words of the artist, "Leaves are so commonplace in nature that we rarely consider them worthy of study. Yet when looked at closely they reveal themselves as marvels of efficiency and beauty.  In a train station, time often means minutes to hurry or to wait through.  But this mural allows the traveler an opportunity for a different view. Like a time line, this mosaic reveals nature as a vehicle of change. Combining nature and time, I encourage the viewer to examine such changes and to appreciate the precious and fleeting quality of our world.  The commuter may take a walk into April, or recall November, even as she hurries to an appointment, or as he heads home from work."</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Faceted glass in stationhouse and elevator towers</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{Railroads and Rooftops} consists of 12 faceted glass panels - four panels in the dormer windows of the station house and four panels in each of the two elevator towers.  In the dormer windows the artist expressed the importance of the train through the landscape of downtown Harrison.  For the top sections of the two elevator towers she created images depicting commuters and trains, with one tower showing contemporary scenes and the other depicting corresponding scenes in a historical context.  During her research into the history of Harrison, the artist discovered the vital role of the railroad to the development of the community; which often was a chief factor in whether a town grew or declined.  The railroad helped create downtown Harrison and brought immigrant workers who eventually became part of the community.</art1_description>
