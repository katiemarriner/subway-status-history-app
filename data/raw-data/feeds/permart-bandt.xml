		<art1_description>The Art Deco forms of this monumental artwork respond to the architecture of the tunnel ventilation building on which it is installed, announcing the time with a glowing welcome.  In the artist's words, the clock's "traditional form and function offer a sense of anticipation, and its sculptural presence instills a sense of wonder by day and at night."  The 86-foot sculpture was commissioned to mark the tunnel's fortieth Anniversary.  While it serves to tell travelers the time and to provide necessary illumination, the piece, more importantly, is a work of art.  "Tunnels are also processional gateways and my work celebrates the passage from one New York City borough to another," Fischer says.  The imagery in the work is a response to the architecture of the tunnel's nearby ventilation building and its era, automobile imagery, and engineering design.</art1_description>
