		<art1_date>1993</art1_date>
		<art1_material>Faceted glass triptych over stairway</art1_material>
		<art1_description>The hundreds of brilliant facets of Romare Bearden's glass triptych pulsate with energy, connected by the black thread of a subway train wending past tenements and skyscrapers.  The work began as a collage maquette; this was then transformed into a glowing artwork in jewel-like colored glass.  The three-paneled work is installed on the wall at the stairway landing. *Bearden was an accomplished artist and {City of Light} skillfully weaves together the spirit found in his beloved music, social concerns, and interest in trains.  The work was the result of a collaboration between Bearden and the fabricators, Benoit Gilsoul and Helmut Schardt.  Following the artist's death in 1988, they were able to complete the work from the preparatory studies and instructions he had left behind.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Bronze reliefs on mezzanine walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{The Open Secret}, a series of bronze reliefs mounted on the mezzanine level, was the first Arts for Transit commissioned work in the subway, and it presents many of artist Houston Conwill's longstanding thematic concerns: community, history, and the creation of sacred spaces as each relates to the African American experience and quest for equality. {The Open Secret} holds mysteries, and viewers can look inside at the objects within.  Two triangular sections serve as a time capsule of life in Harlem in the 1980s.  "The exploration might be of a place or into our own minds where we find eternal secrets that are saved and put in the time capsules for our children and their children," Conwill says.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Valerie Maynard's {Polyrhythmics of Consciousness and Light} was commissioned as part of a phase of renovation of the station that followed earlier work and the installation of {Open Secret }by Houston Conwill.  Maynard's work consists of glass mosaic murals along mezzanine and stairway walls that bring layers of pattern and color to an abstracted geometric field. Against the backgrounds are figural representations of musicians and others in joyful postures.  Maynard's images, in her words, "capture the boundless energy, the beacon of light that was and is our own homegrown Mecca: the Harlem of our dreams, our imaginings and our reality.  Maynard dedicates the work above the stairwells to artists, in recognition of their "flights of creativity."</art2_description>

		<art1_description>Robert Blackburn's dynamic abstract patterns rendered in mosaic suggests the color and movement of the streets above that the artist shapes into beautiful artwork for the subway station.   A master printmaker, Blackburn was a founding member of the Printmaking Workshop in Harlem.  In 2001 MTA Arts for Transit commissioned Blackburn to create a work for the 116th Street  subway station in Harlem.  In failing health, he chose artist Mei-Tei-Sing Smith, a Bearden Fellow at the Printmaking Workshop, to assist him on what would prove to be his last major project.  Once completed, his maquettes were enlarged and manufactured into ceramic and glass mosaics.  Blackburn died in April 2003.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Artist Manuel Vega's childhood memories are revealed in the station's artwork, a series of four mosaics panels.  The panels - {Earth, Air, Fire, and Water} - capture the joyous, colorful atmosphere of {la ciento diez} in images that make the neighborhood come alive.  {Air} illustrates a typical summer-in-the-city diversion: children playing under the spray of a fire hydrant (a {piraguero} shaves a block of ice to make tropical fruit-flavored snow cones of guava, papaya, mango, and tamarindo.)  In {Earth}, a street vendor sells bananas, plantains, papayas, avocados, and coconuts.  {Shang&oacute;} - a deity from the Yoruba pantheon - embodies Harlem's West African roots in {Fire}, dancing to the beat of three bata drummers.  In {Water}, an elderly woman represents motherhood as she carries a bouquet of flowers and leads a child by the hand from a neighborhood bot&aacute;nica.</art1_description>

The mural designs and imagery were also inspired by the petroglyphs of the Ta&iuml;no Indians, Puerto Rico's first inhabitants, and by Mayan and Aztec motifs.  The work is meant to be a lively guide through the streets and subways of New York City and captures the energy and rhythms of the surrounding neighborhoods.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Laura Bradley created her mosaic artwork {City Suite}, as an encompassing series that spoke to the architecture of the station.  Appearing on the walls, floors, and signage, it contains  a terrazzo square that elegantly surrounds a column on the station's mezzanine.  Two large mosaic medallions form the visual centerpiece of the work. Bradley created new name tablets to identify the station that appear to be original and yet they incorporate her medallion design. The {City Suite} mosaics were her inspiration in creating the designs that would be translated into metalwork forms at 96th Street.  Following a project at 23rd Street involving gates, the MTA commissioned new ornamental barriers to be installed system-wide and Bradley's stylized forms  for 96th Street were adopted for use throughout the subway system.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Glass mosaics and etched stone on platform walls above stairs</art1_material>
		<art1_description>In {Happy City}, Peter Sis depicts four large eyes to represent the ingredients of the community and the vibrancy that is New York.  Created with etched stone and glass mosaics and rendered in bold color, above the stairs, the pupils and eyelashes are "drawn" with buildings from the neighborhood, incorporating such landmarks as the Metropolitan, Guggenheim, and Whitney museums, as well as Gracie Mansion.  The irises and whites of the eyes serve as a background for figurative elements that capture the diversity and energy of the community.  According to the artist, "The [people of the city] have children and want the best for their children, so they tell them stories and fairy tales.  The fairy tales are the magic animals which appear to float in throughout the four murals.  In the end they form the carousel with the happy children of all nationalities enjoying the ride.  That is the future of the city."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>For his mosaics, Robert Kushner created bouquets of flowers - from every season - that reflect such influences as Dutch flower paintings and Japanese screens.  Most neighborhoods have flower shops, but they are abundant on the Upper East Side, and have associations with many of the city's finest hospitals, parks, and museums located there.  A painter, sculptor and printmaker, Kushner has always been fascinated by organic motifs.  A key figure of the Pattern and Decoration movement, he continues to feature vegetal motifs in his works, often along with geometric patterns and architectural shapes.  At 77th Street he gives the community a blazing bouquet to brighten the day (and night).</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Riders at this station are treated to the joyous burst of color and shapes that is {Blooming}.   The mosaics defy the corners of the space as the imagery wraps around corners, down steps, and through doorways. *{Blooming} takes its title from Bloomingdale's, located above the station upstairs.  The artist views the subway as a "dreamy underworld" and also a place to wake up, and her pink trees, red shoes and yellow mugs with steaming coffee succeed in gaining the viewers' attention.  Murray says, "I added the stepping shoes and steaming coffee cups, part of the ritual of every morning or evening subway trip."  The images are intended to  "stimulate thoughts about passage, as does the poetry"  that is incorporated into the mural, lines from William Butler Yeats's, "In dreams begin responsibility,"  Gwendolyn Brooks's "Conduct your blooming in the noise and whip of the whirlwind."</art1_description>

The 1,000 square-foot ceramic tile installation contains a series of wide cracks that appear as deep indentations in the form of lightning bolts ripping through the site and exposing bright blue marbleized water tiles.  Revealed within are seascapes that offer a view to another realm.  A ceramic relief architectural frieze of the New York City skyline in red, black, and white wraps around the top portion of the walls, and column-like forms appear as pillars supporting the ceiling.  The passage is made to feel more expansive as the view Yankowitz provides adds dimension, detail, and interest.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Passing Through} is one of the last public works of celebrated abstract painter Al Held; it was being installed at the time of his death.  The colorful and exuberant mural reveals an immense universe in which geometric elements of varying shapes and sizes float freely.  In the 1960s, Held moved from abstraction to tightly controlled geometric work, with two-dimensional figures suspended on the canvas.  Held was curious about how everything is structured and was inspired by theories about the universe and its mysteries.  He described his interest in "images that we believe in but that are beyond our senses and that we can never experience directly."   There is also another subject, that of buildings and architecture.  His imagery powerfully evokes New York City's contemporary energy while acknowledging the forms and styles of the Midtown skyscrapers overhead.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The passageways and waiting areas of Grand Central's subway stations are like a bustling city, an underground community - but without a skyline.  This mosaic artwork brings architectural views down below. *Ferrara has long been interested in the simple and repetitive forms of building, and she uses forms that are simple and schematic, almost primitive-looking structures.  Taken together, they lend a unity and meditative character to the space; as people move through the platforms and passageways, the images seem to shift, and no two vistas are the same.  Ferrara thinks of these as pieces of a mathematical puzzle.  The spare simplicity and economy of design attracts viewers.  Nothing is casual or unintentional in the artist's design, which she describes: "This sequence of stripe/image is calculated.  It can be seen as images on a strip of film, or a line of faces framed in the windows of a passing train."</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Dan Sinclair's {Fast Track and Speedwheels} are assemblages crafted from bright metallic sections that include wavy aluminum sheets, steel wheels, brass disks, copper springs and wires.  Installed within a long passageway between the subway and Grand Central Terminal above, they interpret the speed, energy and train travel imagery into a series of relief sculptures.  The art-deco shapes and various turning wheels, spinning gears and pistons add to the aura of the location, below one of America's premiere rail stations.  "I want my sculpture to make people think of the power of the engines that drive the trains, the speed and efficiency of them . . . the sculptures also reflect the architectural elements of Times Square and the Art Deco glamour of Radio City Music Hall," says the artist.</art2_description>

		<art3_description>{V-Beam} is a functional structure and an aesthetic statement.  Artist Christopher Sproat has combined standard transportation hardware - signage, air circulation, and safety equipment - with his artistic sensibility to integrate the sculpture into the transit environment.  The artwork takes the form of a large V, which Sproat judged to be the most practical shape in terms of access and stability, and is equipped with extruded aluminum panels and light-emitting diodes to carry out its functions.  "Rather than make an artistic or decorative statement and add it to the station so that the viewer knows 'this is art,' I chose to make the entire space exuberant and unique," the artist says.</art3_description>

		<art1_description>The 14 sculptural {Lariat Seat Loops} encircle structural columns at the 33rd Street subway station in a variety of shapely configurations.  In each, says artist James Garvey, "the thick bronze bar ... resembles the lasso demonstration in a Will Rogers film clip."  Useful and decorative, some loops serve as handholds and others as seat rests.  Each bar swells where it touches the surface and is attached to the column with custom-forged bolts. *The {Loops} were handmade and individually crafted in Garvey's forge in Harlem.  Describing the work, he said, "I look at the lariat loops almost as earrings, as ornaments that adorn the architecture and add a little flair to the space.  My aim is to put inspiration into routine treks and refresh people caught up in mundane thoughts."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Valerie Jaudon's {Long Division} at Lexington Avenue and 23rd Street serves as a functional security device and a welcoming entry.  The 60-foot-long steel fence is an intricate pattern of crisscrossing arches and vertical lines that was designed by the artist to work as panels that form a unified set of connecting arch patterns.  "The idea was to make a fence that functions as combination of wall, door, window, and column that allows you to see the entire station," Jaudon says of her work.  Based on the success of Jaudon's ornamental work at 23rd Street, the MTA determined that similar artist-designed railings should be incorporated system-wide.  {(See 96th Street.)}</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Glass, enameled steel, and aluminum frames highlighting historic and architectural elements throughout station complex</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Mary Miss worked with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy to use the rehabilitation of Union Square station as an opportunity to uncover hidden structural elements, cables, and conduits - some still functional and others replaced by new improvements.  Old decorative work reappeared during construction, such as mosaics, pilasters, name plaques, and six terra cotta eagles from the 1904 station, once presumed lost. *Miss brings these treasures to the surface though a network of frames, windows, apertures, and mirrors. The bright red frames stand out; what they frame is more subtle - a bolt, a fragment of ancient-looking mosaic, a piece of rusted steel cable.  Other frames call attention to the station's historic name plaques.   "I'm inviting the public to look below the surface, to see a 'slice' of the station, its structure, its history, says the artist.  In this most public of places, the apertures offer an intimate engagement.  Looking in, you will see the station's workings - sometimes you will see layers of words and reflected images, including your own!"</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Milton Glaser, widely known as a pioneering graphic designer (including the I :3: New York logo) and print maker, created artwork for the Astor Place station that complements the existing historic fabric while making a bold and modern statement.  The station holds excellent examples of terra cotta and mosaics, particularly the Grueby Facience Company's plaques that depict beavers, a source of the Astor family wealth from fur trading. *Glaser described his approach as, "basically a variation on the existing forms.  By extracting fragments of the motifs on the tile panels, enlarging their scale, and placing these pieces in a random pattern, they take on the appearance of a puzzle."  The result is a series of porcelain enamel panels in geometric patterns and color that echo the historic elements but present them in an entirely new way.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Stainless steel and glass sculpture with lights on mezzanine column bases; ceramic tile on station walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>In {Signal}, artist Mel Chin, collaborating with Seneca tribe member Peter Jemison, draws upon the rich history of the Broadway and Lafayette crossroads, once a trading route for the tribes of the Six Nations.  The mezzanine wall tiles depict figures from the nations with arms out-stretched to one another.  The main concourse has conical forms at the base of support pillars shaped like campfires, used to send signals.  Lights within these "campfires" brighten as trains approach and dim as they leave.  Patterns within the steel forms derive from tribal badge patterns, that were based on a fusion of cultures.  Another historical overlay is in the tile patterns around the concourse, they evoke rising smoke while the pattern is inspired by an Iroquois message of peace.  In the artist's words, art should "provoke greater social awareness and responsibility," and this work demonstrates how this can be accomplished.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Ceramic tiles and mosaic banding on platform walls and connecting passageway</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Bing Lee's {Empress Voyage} commemorates the pioneering expedition of the American merchant ship, Empress of China, which in 1794 returned to New York harbor filled with silk, tea, and porcelain (commonly called china, due to its origin).  Through the artist's lighthearted use of Chinese-derived icons, the tiles illustrate aspects of the then-new trade with Asia and celebrates today's Chinatown.  On the platforms, interlocking teapots incorporate the Chinese symbol for "good life."  Other symbols, on the station's upper level, are variations on the symbols for "Asia," "quality," and "cycle."  As trains arrive, debarking passengers are given a choice of reading "Canal Street" in English or the Chinese characters for "Chinatown." "I want to give the viewers art that reminds them of history, but also speaks directly to them," says Lee, "something meaningful but also playful."</art1_description>

		<art1_date>1996</art1_date>
		<art1_description>The Brooklyn Bridge's pioneering use of steel cables and a suspended roadway are repeatedly referenced in the design of artist Mark Gibian's work. Within the west mezzanine a web of cables recalls the graceful forms of the bridge, while overhead a 30-square foot structure, suspended beneath a skylight, frames the cable work.   At the turnstiles, three panels that also use cables serve as a functional barrier.   For the artist, the "lacy" curves of the panels "echo the beauty of the bridge's cross-hatched cables and the feeling of flight as it springs across the East River."  The energy of {Cable Crossing} suggests "the controlled power of the subway and its network of metal and concrete that undergirds the city.   I wanted to explore movement, using soft curves with hard materials," Gibian says.</art1_description>
