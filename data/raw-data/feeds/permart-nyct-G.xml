		<art1_description>Constructed of glass and ceramic tile, Jackie Chang's {Signs of Life} offers text and images arranged as a puzzle throughout the station.  A rock sits atop a pointed shape between two words, "FAITH" and "FATE."  Other words -- "MAN," "KIND," "IT," "SELF" - are in the path of a cresting wave below.  The artist seeks to spark the viewers' imaginations, perhaps hoping that interpretations will emerge over repeated viewings and rumination.  The tone of the messages are enigmatic:  are they optimistic or pessimistic; are they speaking of the past or to the future?   "I kept my titles brief," Chang says.  "I wanted them to be challenging."  In a sense, these bits of what Chang calls "urban poetry" are an acknowledgment of the creative energy flowing through the community.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Elizabeth Murray titled this work {Stream}, to evoke the feet of travelers as they stream out along the passageway.  Murray has shifted from abstraction to recognizable imagery throughout her career and in this work, she created magical forms that reveal her artistic spirit in the vibrant colored mosaics that fill the passageway.   Murray also used imagery with her earlier project, {Blooming}, in the Lexington Avenue and 59th  Street station.  Here the radiant colors evoke the new day with rising suns and the giant steps being taken, as the organic and joyous shapes provide an uplifting jolt of energy to the commuters streaming past.</art1_description>

		<art2_date>1992</art2_date>
		<art2_material>Glass mosaic and ceramic reliefs on station platforms and mezzanine</art2_material>
		<art2_description>The artwork consists of four large-scale ceramic murals that contain sculpted forms that depict architectural formations set into a mosaic background.  Frank Olt feels that the Archways represent a symbol of welcome, strength and beauty. Their form and rich color derive from Romanesque architecture, and provide a welcoming point of entry.  The {Gothic Circle} symbolizes endurance, renewal and perpetuity, and is designed to inspire commuters traveling to and from work.  The {Greek Temple Quad}, as Olt describes it, "consists of four house-shaped pieces, and reinforces the theme of welcome and comfort, but itself resembles a cityscape or place of commerce with all the societal vitality that it implies."</art2_description>

		<art1_material>Glass mosaics on mezzanine walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>In {Look Up, Not Down}, Ellen Harvey asks riders to pretend that they are gazing skyward at the view  that exists above the station.  Her series of mosaic murals depict the sky on a sunny day, with the skyline forming a thin frame at the bottom of each mosaic, and represents the actual cityscape at the time it was created.  The work guides travelers to the surrounding streets at this busy transportation hub.  The piece celebrates the romance of the skyline as seen from Queens, imagined as the center of the city.  At a time when the New York City skyline may be associated with loss, {Look Up, Not Down} shows the skyline as an image of hope and beauty.  The sun marks the former location of the World Trade Center.  In years to come, as the city continues to reinvent itself, the mosaics will serve as a view of a past moment in time.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Glass in windows of Victor Moore Arcade and on 7 platform windscreens</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{Passage} was designed in tandem with the architects, FX + FOWLE, as an integral part of the station.  It features trapezoidal-shaped windows fitted into the steel so they can be opened and allow air into the platform.  The laminated, impact-resistant security glass is layered with a plasma composite material to break up light into the colors of the spectrum.  The artist has said that {Passage} is influenced by the markets, flowers, and colors on the nearby streets.  Tom Patti pioneered the integration of industrial and architectural glass into art.  "The ability of glass to occupy several physical states - transparent, opaque, dense, solid, weightless - all altering our spatial boundary - challenges me," he says.  All of {Passage}'s components were handmade in his studio.  This act of craftsmanship is critical, says Patti, to ensure the integrity of all elements.</art1_description>

		<art1_title>In Memory of the Lost Battalion</art1_title>
		<art1_date>1996</art1_date>
		<art1_material>Stainless steel and faceted glass column covers on mezzanine</art1_material>
		<art1_description>This work includes nine station support beams that are sheathed in iron, stainless steel, and inch-thick architectural glass that seem to stand watch over passing travelers.  The sculpture respects the physical constraints of the station architecture and succeeds in reshaping them through the use of light and materials to construct a powerful memorial to the Lost Battalion - a group of World War I soldiers, mostly New Yorkers, who were lost in battle.  Pablo Tauler uses materials that eerily suggests the Argonne Forest where the soldiers met their fate.  Muscular steel slabs evoke armaments glass refracts light, and organically shaped iron forms twist like branches.  For the sculptor the ironwork inspires memories of the wilderness marshes near his childhood home.  "I am profoundly aware of the importance of the environment to my art," he says.  "Especially interesting to me is the manipulation of light through the use of texture and reflective materials."</art1_description>
