		<art1_description>The wall sculpture consists of two elements, a large ellipse afnd an armature that holds it, constructed of aluminum plate with deep welds.  Gilliam's has long been interested in sculptural and theatrical work that interacts with the space it inhabits.  He began draping his canvases and this led to his public sculpture such as this piece, where aluminum has taken the place of a canvas.  In the artist's words, the work "calls to mind movement, circuits, speed, technology, and passenger ships...the colors used in the piece... refer to colors of the respective subway lines.  The predominant use of blue provides one with a visual solid in a transitional area that is near subterranean."</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Wire-mesh sculpture in platform windscreens</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{Five Points of Observation}, sited on the platform walls of five adjacent subway stations in Queens and Brooklyn,  is composed of five colossal six-foot heads made of copper mesh positioned at different angles and inserted in specially cut openings in the windscreen walls that otherwise would block views from the platforms to the streets below.  Positioning themselves in the heads, subway riders can look out onto the world literally through the eyes of the sculptural forms.  The artist created faces both multiethnic and androgynous, leaving room for viewers to construct for themselves stories of who these haunting forms might be and what they might signify.  The faces are constructed with steel armatures and a grid of wire mesh, which serves a protective as well as expressive function.  The positioning of the forms varies from station to station, giving them further variety and expressiveness.</art1_description>

Designs that symbolize the sun and the wheel of the trains feature a series of circles and vibrant colors that add complexity.  The colors reflect the cycle of the day, beginning with yellow for morning and blue for night.  The circular shapes also reflect the movement and life of the neighborhood.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Using design, patterns, and color as cultural expression, {Culture Swirl} links the early 17th to 19th century Dutch and English history in the area with the current vibrant culturally rich community.  Drawn from historic Dutch and English sources combined with curling, swirling patterns of African textiles and ornate wrought iron doors and gates, the bold, colorful artwork features bright, sun-filled colors to reflect tropical climates and traditional cultural heritage.  The sequence of windscreens create a dynamic progression and sense of movement as viewed by passengers riding on passing trains.

The final result transforms daily activities into striking images - people arriving home from school or work, tree buds in springtime, and lights from the businesses surrounding the elevated structures.  {El Views} is embedded with the sensibility and humanity of the people and place that were its inspiration.</art1_description>

Robinson says, "A simple subway ride is a cultural exploration, a cross-section of a city as it moves from past to present and on to tomorrow.  All races, creeds, and colors interconnect on a common path to an endless variety of destinations. Each rider is enriched by daily discoveries of new faces, places, and things....They are vignettes made of memory and experience, an ode to a lifetime spent riding in and dreaming on the train, as it speeds through the darkness and into the light."</art1_description>

You can board the jazz express and take a jazz, rock, funk, or salsa journey of your choice."</art1_description>

The imagery is abstract, with precision in the quality of line and forms, which was a particular challenge since the medium is glass.  Robin Holder says images "incorporate symbols from various cultures that relate to the theme of: interaction, movement, and society in motion.

		<art1_description>Annette Davidek's murals at Lorimer Street in Brooklyn illustrate the fractured and fragmented language of nature in a medium well-suited for her expressive work. {Roundlet Series} reveals the countless varieties of organic forms in botany. At times the murals recall blossoming flowers, twisting branches, or meandering patterns that mimic genetic elements. The challenge in translating the artist's work-on-paper into the faceted glass murals was to capture the detail and complexity of the compositions while maintaining their captivating qualities.  Faceted glass delivers a striking quality of translucency, texture, and range of color.  Dramatic contrasts between the contour and the content becomes apparent against the background and the result adds vibrancy to the station platform.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Artist Mara Held's {El in 16 Notes} is a meditation on variations in pattern caused by differing qualities of light and the creation of overlapping forms and layers. The inspiration for the imagery of the piece was originally derived from cut-out dress patterns.  Through the minimal yet elegant shifts in color and pattern that are occasionally pierced by playful curving lines, the work enables the viewer to witness the light and the neighboring skyline as it emerges through the glass planes.  Held played particular attention to the colors and role of natural light to animate and illuminate the work, which graces the platform with light and color.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Ellsworth Ausby created eight triptychs for the station's platform windscreens that explore the relationship of man to the universe.  In a subtle way, the brilliantly colored forms evoke the feeling of the swirling cosmos.  For this commission, the artist produced a series of drawings later translated into a faceted glass.  According to the artist, he is particularly attracted by "the idea of traveling in infinite space, which is as a passenger on the Earth Express line, experienced through the cycle of the seasons."  He was particularly pleased to work with faceted glass windows, "a new and exciting medium for me to work with,  ...  These windows have allowed me to expand my understanding of the possibilities that this concept has as public art,....It is my hope that these windows express what I feel is the spirit of New York, the hustle and bustle, the fast pace of the city."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Ming Fay brings to the station the liveliness of the thriving marketplace overhead in this storied Lower East Side neighborhood.  The artist extensively researched the neighborhood's history, and created by watercolor sketches that were transformed into glass mosaic murals by craftsmen.  The images of Shad Crossing celebrate the return of the once abundant fish to New York and water as a metaphor for "crossing." {Delancey Orchard} is the mural on the Manhattan-bound platform, inspired by the prominent  DeLancey family's eighteenth century farm, which stretched from the East River to the Hudson River.  The farm's cherry orchard was located where Orchard Street stands and is memorialized with radiant cherry trees on the Brooklyn-bound platform.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Ceramic tiles and mosaic banding on platform walls and connecting passageway</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Bing Lee's {Empress Voyage} commemorates the pioneering expedition of the American merchant ship, Empress of China, which in 1794 returned to New York harbor filled with silk, tea, and porcelain (commonly called china, due to its origin).  Through the artist's lighthearted use of Chinese-derived icons, the tiles illustrate aspects of the then-new trade with Asia and celebrates today's Chinatown.  On the platforms, interlocking teapots incorporate the Chinese symbol for "good life."  Other symbols, on the station's upper level, are variations on the symbols for "Asia," "quality," and "cycle."  As trains arrive, debarking passengers are given a choice of reading "Canal Street" in English or the Chinese characters for "Chinatown." "I want to give the viewers art that reminds them of history, but also speaks directly to them," says Lee, "something meaningful but also playful."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The Brooklyn Bridge's pioneering use of steel cables and a suspended roadway are repeatedly referenced in the design of artist Mark Gibian's work. Within the west mezzanine a web of cables recalls the graceful forms of the bridge, while overhead a 30-square foot structure, suspended beneath a skylight, frames the cable work.   At the turnstiles, three panels that also use cables serve as a functional barrier.   For the artist, the "lacy" curves of the panels "echo the beauty of the bridge's cross-hatched cables and the feeling of flight as it springs across the East River."  The energy of {Cable Crossing} suggests "the controlled power of the subway and its network of metal and concrete that undergirds the city.   I wanted to explore movement, using soft curves with hard materials," Gibian says.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Steel and light sculpture in passageway ceiling between A, C and 4, 5 stations</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Nancy Holt's steel ceiling sculpture incorporating lighting at the Fulton Street/Broadway-Nassau subway station, is an example of Arts for Transit's early efforts to foster collaborations with station architects, (in this case, Lee Harris Pomeroy) to integrate the artwork with the architecture.   An environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars. *In {Astral Grating}, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  "The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus, and Piscus Austrinus," says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented. *{The plan for the new Fulton Street Transit Center, includes the reinstallation of Astral Grating  in the reconfigured passageways.}</art1_description>

		<art2_description>At the turn of the twentieth century the McAlpin Hotel was one of the places to be seen.  Frederick Dana Marsh created a series of twenty terra cotta murals for its walls, with maritime themes celebrating New York's important seaport.  Times change, and the hotel became apartments and the murals were removed.  In 2000, six of the murals were installed in the station and was the Marine Grill's famed ironwork entrance gate.  All of this blends well with the terra cotta plaques installed elsewhere in the system by the original builders of the subway. *{The rebuilding of the station, as part of the Fulton Street Transit Center, is underway and requires the murals' removal, restoration, and relocation.}</art2_description>
