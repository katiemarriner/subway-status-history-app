		<art1_date>1996</art1_date>
		<art1_material>Stainless steel and faceted glass column covers on mezzanine</art1_material>
		<art1_description>This work includes nine station support beams that are sheathed in iron, stainless steel, and inch-thick architectural glass that seem to stand watch over passing travelers.  The sculpture respects the physical constraints of the station architecture and succeeds in reshaping them through the use of light and materials to construct a powerful memorial to the Lost Battalion - a group of World War I soldiers, mostly New Yorkers, who were lost in battle.  Pablo Tauler uses materials that eerily suggests the Argonne Forest where the soldiers met their fate.  Muscular steel slabs evoke armaments glass refracts light, and organically shaped iron forms twist like branches.  For the sculptor the ironwork inspires memories of the wilderness marshes near his childhood home.  "I am profoundly aware of the importance of the environment to my art," he says.  "Especially interesting to me is the manipulation of light through the use of texture and reflective materials."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Passage} was designed in tandem with the architects, FX + FOWLE, as an integral part of the station.  It features trapezoidal-shaped windows fitted into the steel so they can be opened and allow air into the platform.  The laminated, impact-resistant security glass is layered with a plasma composite material to break up light into the colors of the spectrum.  The artist has said that {Passage} is influenced by the markets, flowers, and colors on the nearby streets.  Tom Patti pioneered the integration of industrial and architectural glass into art.  "The ability of glass to occupy several physical states - transparent, opaque, dense, solid, weightless - all altering our spatial boundary - challenges me," he says.  All of {Passage}'s components were handmade in his studio.  This act of craftsmanship is critical, says Patti, to ensure the integrity of all elements.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>In {Look Up, Not Down}, Ellen Harvey asks riders to pretend that they are gazing skyward at the view  that exists above the station.  Her series of mosaic murals depict the sky on a sunny day, with the skyline forming a thin frame at the bottom of each mosaic, and represents the actual cityscape at the time it was created.  The work guides travelers to the surrounding streets at this busy transportation hub.  The piece celebrates the romance of the skyline as seen from Queens, imagined as the center of the city.  At a time when the New York City skyline may be associated with loss, {Look Up, Not Down} shows the skyline as an image of hope and beauty.  The sun marks the former location of the World Trade Center.  In years to come, as the city continues to reinvent itself, the mosaics will serve as a view of a past moment in time.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Elizabeth Murray titled this work {Stream}, to evoke the feet of travelers as they stream out along the passageway.  Murray has shifted from abstraction to recognizable imagery throughout her career and in this work, she created magical forms that reveal her artistic spirit in the vibrant colored mosaics that fill the passageway.   Murray also used imagery with her earlier project, {Blooming}, in the Lexington Avenue and 59th  Street station.  Here the radiant colors evoke the new day with rising suns and the giant steps being taken, as the organic and joyous shapes provide an uplifting jolt of energy to the commuters streaming past.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>The artwork consists of four large-scale ceramic murals that contain sculpted forms that depict architectural formations set into a mosaic background.  Frank Olt feels that the Archways represent a symbol of welcome, strength and beauty. Their form and rich color derive from Romanesque architecture, and provide a welcoming point of entry.  The {Gothic Circle} symbolizes endurance, renewal and perpetuity, and is designed to inspire commuters traveling to and from work.  The {Greek Temple Quad}, as Olt describes it, "consists of four house-shaped pieces, and reinforces the theme of welcome and comfort, but itself resembles a cityscape or place of commerce with all the societal vitality that it implies."</art2_description>

		<art1_description>{Tunnel Vision} consists of handmade tiles that line the 51st Street and Lexington Avenue subway underpass.   The 1,000 square-foot ceramic tile installation contains a series of wide cracks that appear as deep indentations in the form of lightning bolts ripping through the site and exposing bright blue marbleized water tiles.  Revealed within are seascapes that offer a view to another realm.  A ceramic relief architectural frieze of the New York City skyline in red, black, and white wraps around the top portion of the walls, and column-like forms appear as pillars supporting the ceiling.  The passage is made to feel more expansive as the view Yankowitz provides adds dimension, detail, and interest.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Passing Through} is one of the last public works of celebrated abstract painter Al Held; it was being installed at the time of his death.  The colorful and exuberant mural reveals an immense universe in which geometric elements of varying shapes and sizes float freely.  In the 1960s, Held moved from abstraction to tightly controlled geometric work, with two-dimensional figures suspended on the canvas.  Held was curious about how everything is structured and was inspired by theories about the universe and its mysteries.  He described his interest in "images that we believe in but that are beyond our senses and that we can never experience directly."   There is also another subject, that of buildings and architecture.  His imagery powerfully evokes New York City's contemporary energy while acknowledging the forms and styles of the Midtown skyscrapers overhead.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Ralph Fassanella painted a subject with which he was deeply familiar.  Talking about {Subway Riders}, the artist reflected: "I'd ride the subway every day... I'd ride and ride and sketch and sketch.  I love the subway.  It pulls the city together, pulls people together in a magic way.  Here I show the subway riders at night after a hard day's work.  Everyone is separate, alone, but very much together.  It's noisy with the creaks and squeals, but peaceful too, because we move to a rhythm and cadence that gets inside us; that's comforting, like the noise of the city itself."  Fasanella grew up in Greenwich Village, and worked as an iceman and union organizer, producing paintings in what would become known as urban folk style.</art2_description>

		<art1_description>One of the largest artworks in the MTA system runs under 42nd Street along the corridor connecting the B, D, F, V lines with the 7 train.  Above the site is the Main Library and Bryant Park, which are reflected in the artwork below.  On the walls of the tunnel we see rock outcroppings, tree roots, pipes, animal burrows, and literary quotations.  The artist based the project on the idea of systems.  In her words, "People travel the subway system, water and other utility services are delivered by pipes, and plants and trees that provide grace and softness against the city's sharper edges find their way to water and nutrients underground through a system of roots.  In a similar way, literature is shared by systems of learning and lending, and many animals inhabit systems of burrows just as humans systematically divide portions of larger habitats aboveground."  At the west end of the tunnel, color asserts itself in a frieze of rock and plant forms with a quote from psychologist Carl Jung:  "Nature must not win the game, but she cannot lose."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Michele Oka Doner's {Radiant Site}, at the busy 34th Street-Herald Square subway station, fills a rectilinear floor-to-ceiling passage with golden light.  The midsection of the corridor is the brightest, glazed in copper-toned tiles; the tiles grow darker and reflect less light along the top and bottom of the passageway.  The result is a gently glowing surface.  The artist made the 11,000 tiles one-by-one by hand on a century-old foot-press at the venerable Pewabic Pottery in Detroit.  Their slightly irregular shapes and uneven surfaces were then hand-glazed, varying the recipe in tiny increments so as to achieve the desired luminosity.  Doner says that she considers not only the physical and chemical properties of the materials she will use but also "their psychic and cosmic qualities."</art1_description>

		<art2_description>A green painted rectangular structure is suspended from the subway platform and engages travelers with its ability to produce sounds.  Travelers place their hands in front of the box-like apparatus on the subway platform and a burst of musical notes are released on the opposite side, playing to the person on the other side.  The hand motions elicit an outpouring of sounds that evoke urban life and bring about duets between strangers waiting for their respective trains.  Artist Christopher Janney creates sound sculptures and public art that use sound and motion.  This work brings about interaction and pleased participants, serving in Janney's words, as "a foil for getting total strangers to interact with each other."</art2_description>

		<art3_description>In the 34th Street-Herald Square subway station riders are met by large, luminous orbs that seem to hover in space.  Made of coiled aluminum rods - formed in a manner similar to the way in which ceramicists build pots from clay - the spheres are suspended on a framework of small beams from the larger steel structural components of the station.  {Halo} contrasts the aesthetic with the utilitarian and the result is "an unexpected serenity."  The artist say, "It was my aim to create an enigmatic distribution of objects that would stand in sharp contrast to the rectilinear nature of the site, and in doing so, to establish an oasis of visual language amid an otherwise functional environment."</art3_description>

The artist's concept was for the delicately balanced paddles to spin and flutter in the wind generated by approaching and departing trains.  From the artist's proposal:  "As every veteran subway rider knows - whether actively or intuitively - the approach of a train is preceded by a gust of wind funneling down the track. It's my interest to build and install a series of subway 'wind paddles' that will utilize and make visible these subterranean breezes.  The varying amounts of wind will set the brightly colored paddles floating, tilting, and spinning in descriptive patterns."</art4_description>

		<art1_material>Stainless steel and glass sculpture with lights on mezzanine column bases; ceramic tile on station walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>In {Signal}, artist Mel Chin, collaborating with Seneca tribe member Peter Jemison, draws upon the rich history of the Broadway and Lafayette crossroads, once a trading route for the tribes of the Six Nations.  The mezzanine wall tiles depict figures from the nations with arms out-stretched to one another.  The main concourse has conical forms at the base of support pillars shaped like campfires, used to send signals.  Lights within these "campfires" brighten as trains approach and dim as they leave.  Patterns within the steel forms derive from tribal badge patterns, that were based on a fusion of cultures.  Another historical overlay is in the tile patterns around the concourse, they evoke rising smoke while the pattern is inspired by an Iroquois message of peace.  In the artist's words, art should "provoke greater social awareness and responsibility," and this work demonstrates how this can be accomplished.</art1_description>
