		<art1_material>Painted aluminum sculpture on wall above entrance</art1_material>
		<art1_description>The wall sculpture consists of two elements, a large ellipse and an armature that holds it, constructed of aluminum plate with deep welds.  Gilliam's has long been interested in sculptural and theatrical work that interacts with the space it inhabits.  He began draping his canvases and this led to his public sculpture such as this piece, where aluminum has taken the place of a canvas.  In the artist's words, the work "calls to mind movement, circuits, speed, technology, and passenger ships...the colors used in the piece... refer to colors of the respective subway lines.  The predominant use of blue provides one with a visual solid in a transitional area that is near subterranean."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Passage} was designed in tandem with the architects, FX + FOWLE, as an integral part of the station.  It features trapezoidal-shaped windows fitted into the steel so they can be opened and allow air into the platform.  The laminated, impact-resistant security glass is layered with a plasma composite material to break up light into the colors of the spectrum.  The artist has said that {Passage} is influenced by the markets, flowers, and colors on the nearby streets.  Tom Patti pioneered the integration of industrial and architectural glass into art.  "The ability of glass to occupy several physical states - transparent, opaque, dense, solid, weightless - all altering our spatial boundary - challenges me," he says.  All of {Passage}'s components were handmade in his studio.  This act of craftsmanship is critical, says Patti, to ensure the integrity of all elements.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>In {Look Up, Not Down}, Ellen Harvey asks riders to pretend that they are gazing skyward at the view  that exists above the station.  Her series of mosaic murals depict the sky on a sunny day, with the skyline forming a thin frame at the bottom of each mosaic, and represents the actual cityscape at the time it was created.  The work guides travelers to the surrounding streets at this busy transportation hub.  The piece celebrates the romance of the skyline as seen from Queens, imagined as the center of the city.  At a time when the New York City skyline may be associated with loss, {Look Up, Not Down} shows the skyline as an image of hope and beauty.  The sun marks the former location of the World Trade Center.  In years to come, as the city continues to reinvent itself, the mosaics will serve as a view of a past moment in time.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Elizabeth Murray titled this work {Stream}, to evoke the feet of travelers as they stream out along the passageway.  Murray has shifted from abstraction to recognizable imagery throughout her career and in this work, she created magical forms that reveal her artistic spirit in the vibrant colored mosaics that fill the passageway.   Murray also used imagery with her earlier project, {Blooming}, in the Lexington Avenue and 59th  Street station.  Here the radiant colors evoke the new day with rising suns and the giant steps being taken, as the organic and joyous shapes provide an uplifting jolt of energy to the commuters streaming past.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>The artwork consists of four large-scale ceramic murals that contain sculpted forms that depict architectural formations set into a mosaic background.  Frank Olt feels that the Archways represent a symbol of welcome, strength and beauty. Their form and rich color derive from Romanesque architecture, and provide a welcoming point of entry.  The {Gothic Circle} symbolizes endurance, renewal and perpetuity, and is designed to inspire commuters traveling to and from work.  The {Greek Temple Quad}, as Olt describes it, "consists of four house-shaped pieces, and reinforces the theme of welcome and comfort, but itself resembles a cityscape or place of commerce with all the societal vitality that it implies."</art2_description>

		<art1_description>{Passing Through} is one of the last public works of celebrated abstract painter Al Held; it was being installed at the time of his death.  The colorful and exuberant mural reveals an immense universe in which geometric elements of varying shapes and sizes float freely.  In the 1960s, Held moved from abstraction to tightly controlled geometric work, with two-dimensional figures suspended on the canvas.  Held was curious about how everything is structured and was inspired by theories about the universe and its mysteries.  He described his interest in "images that we believe in but that are beyond our senses and that we can never experience directly."   There is also another subject, that of buildings and architecture.  His imagery powerfully evokes New York City's contemporary energy while acknowledging the forms and styles of the Midtown skyscrapers overhead.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Tunnel Vision} consists of handmade tiles that line the 51st Street and Lexington Avenue subway underpass.   The 1,000 square-foot ceramic tile installation contains a series of wide cracks that appear as deep indentations in the form of lightning bolts ripping through the site and exposing bright blue marbleized water tiles.  Revealed within are seascapes that offer a view to another realm.  A ceramic relief architectural frieze of the New York City skyline in red, black, and white wraps around the top portion of the walls, and column-like forms appear as pillars supporting the ceiling.  The passage is made to feel more expansive as the view Yankowitz provides adds dimension, detail, and interest.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Ralph Fassanella painted a subject with which he was deeply familiar.  Talking about {Subway Riders}, the artist reflected: "I'd ride the subway every day... I'd ride and ride and sketch and sketch.  I love the subway.  It pulls the city together, pulls people together in a magic way.  Here I show the subway riders at night after a hard day's work.  Everyone is separate, alone, but very much together.  It's noisy with the creaks and squeals, but peaceful too, because we move to a rhythm and cadence that gets inside us; that's comforting, like the noise of the city itself."  Fasanella grew up in Greenwich Village, and worked as an iceman and union organizer, producing paintings in what would become known as urban folk style.</art2_description>

		<art1_description>Artist Matt Mullican created an 8-foot by 68-foot sandblasted black granite mural that presents a time-line of the history of the station site, atop which sits an office tower.  (The subway station was rehabilitated in concert with the office development.)  Mullican employs an iconographic visual vocabulary through which he reveals the site's past as rural, occupied by a cabin, and as a previous site of Madison Square Garden.  Depictions of maps and aerial views are also part of the large mural.  Mullican's pictographs reward the repeat visitor with layers of meaning as the piece is viewed again and again.  Mullican communicates through a simplified visual system, but his signs provide deeper meaning to those who look.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Glass mosaics on mezzanine walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Lisa Dinhofer uses representations of toy marbles to challenge our imaginations by playing with illusions that alter physical perceptions.  Her work spans a 32-foot-long wall and two adjacent side walls.  Created in glass mosaic, the main artwork consists of a gold-colored trompe l'oeil frame surrounding a black and white tiled floor that serves as the backdrop for the marbles, which seem to roll toward the viewer. On the side walls, free-floating marbles seem to breaking free in space.  Dinhofer comments, "Every object I paint actually exists; I work from life.  The space I create is believable - but not real.  Because I design my own space, I call myself an 'illusionist' painter rather than a 'realist'.  The space in my work is invented.  It's flattened - like the space we see on a television or a computer screen."</art1_description>

		<art1_date>1977-1992, 2002-present</art1_date>
		<art1_description>The work of art, {Times Square} is an invisible, deliberately unmarked area of sound at the north end of the pedestrian island at Broadway between 46th and 45th Streets. Conceived and originally installed by artist Max Neuhaus, it provides a rich harmonic sound texture that emerges from a large underground vault covered by a grating. *Commenting on artwork, Neuhaus has said, "For those who find and accept the work's anomaly, the island becomes a different place, separate, but including its surroundings. People, having no way of knowing that it has been deliberately made, usually claim the work as a place of their own discovering." *Installed by the artist in 1977, the artwork remained active until 1992, when Neuhaus moved abroad. In 2002 it was reinstated with the help of the Times Square Business Improvement District, MTA Arts for Transit, and the Dia Art Foundation, which will assume responsibility for its upkeep.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{Times Square Mural} captures the spirit of the subway, its linear movement and dynamic energy.  With a nod to both the past and the future- its central image is a futuristic bullet shaped car zipping through an underground station.  And not just any station, this is Times Square, in the heart of New York City. *Lichtenstein was born in New York in 1923 and spent his last years here.  {Times Square Mural} reflects his career, with references to, and variations on, his earlier works.  Lichtenstein also freely appropriated and incorporated images from the works of other artists and designers in his work.  For instance, the hooded figure at the right of the mural is from the old Buck Rogers comic strips and the iconic 42 image is from a series of drawings of the architectural detail of the subway.  It is a signature work that honors its creator and the place in which it is located.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>Jack Beal uses classical mythology to comment on the relationship between what is above and below the surface - an apt metaphor for the subway.  The work consists of two large mosaic panels that illustrate the mythological character Persephone.  Instead of fasting, she ate a pomegranate and as punishment, is banished underground for six months of the year.  However, she is permitted to spend six months above ground on earth with her mother.  In mythology, the periods above and below ground were the beginning of seasons, which Beal uses in his titles.  Beal finds universality in the myth and brings it to life in a place filled with movement and purpose, bringing beauty underground.</art2_description>

		<art3_description>Think of Times Square and a variety of images, sights, sounds, and scents come to mind.  Whatever they are, chances are you will find it in {Times Square: 35 Times}, a series of artworks encased within glass blocks and set into the walls of the station.  Toby Buonagurio conceived the work around three themes emblematic of the energetic vibrancy of midtown Manhattan: performing arts, fashion, and street life - all recognizable to the everyday passerby and to the thousands of tourists who visit the city.  The ceramics are installed in illuminated shadowboxes throughout the Times Square subway station complex.</art3_description>

		<art4_date>2001</art4_date>
		<art4_material>Glass mosaics on stairway wall between N, Q, W, R and S mezzanines</art4_material>
		<art4_description>The enormous mosaic mural is the focal point of the mezzanine in the Times Square subway complex.  Its shimmering and detailed surface pays tribute to the diversity and strength of New York City - its neighborhoods, cultural life, recreational pleasures, love of sports and, of course, its subway system.  {New York in Transit} was Jacob Lawrence's last public work.  In it he evokes city life seen from an elevated train and the sensitive and loving portrait shows a slice of city life and is a parting gift to New York City, seen by millions of people who live and visit here.</art4_description>

		<art5_date>2008</art5_date>
		<art5_material>Glass mosaic in lower mezzanine and 41st Street passageway between Port Authority and Times Square</art5_material>
		<art5_description>It's been said that if you stand long enough in Times Square, you will meet everyone you've ever known. Long known as the crossroads of the world, Times Square is famous for many things, but mostly for its crowds, particularly the spirited celebration each New Year's Eve when hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and visitors-joined by television viewers around the world, gather to watch the ball drop to usher in the New Year. Sharing hopes for the future, the huge crowds are televised against a neon background.  *In {The Revelers}, Jane Dickson celebrates this age-old impulse to gather. Her mosaic artwork consists of approximately 70 expressive life-size figures. Each is in motion, walking, gesturing, linking arms, or dancing; all enjoying themselves and each other's company. The central frieze of figures are presaged by a scattering of figures in groups of two or three walking in both directions along the corridors that lead to the central open space of the station complex, near the stairs to the 1, 2, 3 lines. These smaller groups share the space with commuters traveling through the passageways that connect the subway stations at Seventh and Eighth Avenues.</art5_description>

		<art1_title>The Garden of Circus Delights</art1_title>
		<art1_date>2001</art1_date>
		<art1_material>Glass mosaic throughout station</art1_material>
		<art1_description>{The Garden of Circus Delights} is the artist's homage to the circus, which makes annual visits to Madison Square Garden, located above the station, and also connected to the Long Island Rail Road.  Eric Fischl's work is narrative and this work follows in this tradition.  A series of murals takes commuters from the familiar to the bizarre circus world.  "I thought it would be amusing," Fischl says, "to do a contemporary Dante's Inferno, to turn commuting into a spiritual quest."  The murals portray fire-breathers, acrobats, and animals; gradually one realizes that a commuter has left home and been pulled into the circus, where he meets incredible circus characters and then, on the other side of the tent, he emerges in the white light and harmony, a commuter again, but transported and transformed."</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Bronze sculpture on railings, beams, and columns throughout station</art1_material>
		<art1_description>The scores of figures created by Tom Otterness to {Life Underground} invigorate and transform the transit environment into a place of joy and whimsy.  *His small-scale sculptures invoke the subway and lore of the city and include an alligator rising out of a sewer to devour a man, workers carrying oversize versions of the tools used to build the subways, and people sneaking under fences to watch the construction or sweep up piles of pennies.  There are also colossal feet and a totem-like sculpture whose human features are formed into the shape of a telephone.  *Otterness placed his creations in unexpected places-beneath stairs and pillars, hanging from the ceiling, and on benches and railings-to surprise and delight riders as they come upon these humorous and captivating inhabitants.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Bronze sculptures on token booth, railings, and beams throughout mezzanine</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Walter Martin and Paloma Mu&ntilde;oz have turned the Canal Street Station into a subterranean aviary.  There are dozens of birds - 174 grackles and blackbirds, in a number of different poses, and seven crows, all cast in bronze and given a glossy black patina.  They are seen roosting on railings and perched in groups, like people waiting for the train, watching, lost in thought, or chatting.  Birds, the artists note, are very social creatures - just like New Yorkers, and riders may find echoes of themselves and other subway riders in their lively expressions.  Canal Street is a busy commercial thoroughfare, devoid of nature.  {A Gathering} compensates for this by enlivening the space and providing respite from the dense traffic and bustling commercialism above.</art1_description>
