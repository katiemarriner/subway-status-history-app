		<art1_description>{Uptown New York}, a colorful, airy celebration of apartment life in the Bronx, is the centerpiece of the Tremont Avenue subway station's renovation.  Drawn from his childhood memory, artist Frank Hampton created a tableau taken from the viewpoint of an actual rooftop location.  The viewer, looking through a building, sees the neighbors' furniture, the continuing view of nearby rooftops, other apartment buildings, and beyond to the skyscrapers of Manhattan.  "I grew up in the Bronx gazing out of apartment windows that look out onto fire escapes, store signs, laundry, and buildings upon buildings," said Hampton.  "These have always seemed like mosaics to me, colorful, interacting, and in constant motion.  Windows played the role of a yard I didn't have."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Vito Acconci creates the 161st Street Yankee Stadium station as an archaeological site and dislocates walls that allow the curious to "see" the stone and steel underneath.  Elsewhere, protruding and receding walls provide seating for waiting travelers.  Parts of the project thrust through floors and ceilings and at one point even project aboveground.  The overall effect is as if the station has been pushed and pulled in various directions to accentuate the relationship of the building to the earth into which it has been inserted. *This project was one of the first collaborative efforts undertaken by Arts for Transit. The architects, di Domenico   Partners, in their redesign of the station, were challenged to open the lower levels to allow light to flow inside.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>At the Yankee Stadium elevated station, walls that open in Vito Acconci's shifting architectural forms reveal Helene Brandt's Room of Tranquility where all is peaceful, still, and reassuring.  Trees and sky seem real; the space appears to expand and depth is convincingly suggested.  In the artist's words, "I envisioned an imaginary room revealed behind the sliding tile walls - a quiet, restful space with a radiant view to the outside, a room of tranquility.  I wanted the room to have illusionary windows that would seem to let the outside world penetrate into the station."  Brandt rose to the challenge of responding to the site with a work that relates to Acconci's in counterpoint.  As she stated, "I want my {Room of Tranquility} to look as if it has always existed and is only now exposed to view by the sliding tile walls."  Her site-specific achieves a place of serenity, yet close to the roar of the crowds.</art2_description>

		<art1_description>A monumental and vibrant porcelain tile wall drawing by Sol LeWitt has been installed at 59th Street-Columbus Circle. The artist created the proposal in 2004 and, working with Dattner Architects, selected the site in an expansive wall facing a double-wide stairway and landing that leads from the mezzanine to the platforms of the A, C, B, D and 1 trains. Titled {Whirls and twirls (MTA)}, the artwork is 53 feet wide and by 11 feet high and consists of 250 porcelain tiles in six colors, each cut to meet the artist's specifications. The artist created the drawing/maquette for the project, reviewed and selected materials, and approved color samples prior to his death in 2007. *The artist is known for his sculptures and his wall drawings, in which detailed directions are provided for the execution of the artwork in paint or pencil. The site-specific piece - unique because it is a permanent public installation of a wall drawing - is a bravura work of precision, with swooping curves and vertical and horizontal bars in vibrant color that completely fills the space. The tile was cut to the exact dimensions of the drawing to ensure that the scale of the work and the color sequences are as the artist intended. *Sol LeWitt (1928-2007) is a celebrated artist who has had hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries worldwide since 1965. His work includes more than 1,100 wall drawings, photographs, hundreds of works on paper, and geometry-based sculptures. An exhibition at Mass MOCA in North Adams, Massachusetts, features 105 wall drawings in a specially designed museum space and will be on view through 2033.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>One of the largest artworks in the MTA system runs under 42nd Street along the corridor connecting the B, D, F, V lines with the 7 train.  Above the site is the Main Library and Bryant Park, which are reflected in the artwork below.  On the walls of the tunnel we see rock outcroppings, tree roots, pipes, animal burrows, and literary quotations.  The artist based the project on the idea of systems.  In her words, "People travel the subway system, water and other utility services are delivered by pipes, and plants and trees that provide grace and softness against the city's sharper edges find their way to water and nutrients underground through a system of roots.  In a similar way, literature is shared by systems of learning and lending, and many animals inhabit systems of burrows just as humans systematically divide portions of larger habitats aboveground."  At the west end of the tunnel, color asserts itself in a frieze of rock and plant forms with a quote from psychologist Carl Jung:  "Nature must not win the game, but she cannot lose."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Michele Oka Doner's {Radiant Site}, at the busy 34th Street-Herald Square subway station, fills a rectilinear floor-to-ceiling passage with golden light.  The midsection of the corridor is the brightest, glazed in copper-toned tiles; the tiles grow darker and reflect less light along the top and bottom of the passageway.  The result is a gently glowing surface.  The artist made the 11,000 tiles one-by-one by hand on a century-old foot-press at the venerable Pewabic Pottery in Detroit.  Their slightly irregular shapes and uneven surfaces were then hand-glazed, varying the recipe in tiny increments so as to achieve the desired luminosity.  Doner says that she considers not only the physical and chemical properties of the materials she will use but also "their psychic and cosmic qualities."</art1_description>

		<art2_description>A green painted rectangular structure is suspended from the subway platform and engages travelers with its ability to produce sounds.  Travelers place their hands in front of the box-like apparatus on the subway platform and a burst of musical notes are released on the opposite side, playing to the person on the other side.  The hand motions elicit an outpouring of sounds that evoke urban life and bring about duets between strangers waiting for their respective trains.  Artist Christopher Janney creates sound sculptures and public art that use sound and motion.  This work brings about interaction and pleased participants, serving in Janney's words, as "a foil for getting total strangers to interact with each other."</art2_description>

		<art3_description>In the 34th Street-Herald Square subway station riders are met by large, luminous orbs that seem to hover in space.  Made of coiled aluminum rods - formed in a manner similar to the way in which ceramicists build pots from clay - the spheres are suspended on a framework of small beams from the larger steel structural components of the station.  {Halo} contrasts the aesthetic with the utilitarian and the result is "an unexpected serenity."  The artist say, "It was my aim to create an enigmatic distribution of objects that would stand in sharp contrast to the rectilinear nature of the site, and in doing so, to establish an oasis of visual language amid an otherwise functional environment."</art3_description>

		<art4_description>A series of red wind paddles, each 12 long, hangs between the east wall of the station and each of the 14 columns that run the length of the wall.  The artist's concept was for the delicately balanced paddles to spin and flutter in the wind generated by approaching and departing trains.  From the artist's proposal:  "As every veteran subway rider knows - whether actively or intuitively - the approach of a train is preceded by a gust of wind funneling down the track. It's my interest to build and install a series of subway 'wind paddles' that will utilize and make visible these subterranean breezes.  The varying amounts of wind will set the brightly colored paddles floating, tilting, and spinning in descriptive patterns."</art4_description>

		<art1_material>Stainless steel and glass sculpture with lights on mezzanine column bases; ceramic tile on station walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>In {Signal}, artist Mel Chin, collaborating with Seneca tribe member Peter Jemison, draws upon the rich history of the Broadway and Lafayette crossroads, once a trading route for the tribes of the Six Nations.  The mezzanine wall tiles depict figures from the nations with arms out-stretched to one another.  The main concourse has conical forms at the base of support pillars shaped like campfires, used to send signals.  Lights within these "campfires" brighten as trains approach and dim as they leave.  Patterns within the steel forms derive from tribal badge patterns, that were based on a fusion of cultures.  Another historical overlay is in the tile patterns around the concourse, they evoke rising smoke while the pattern is inspired by an Iroquois message of peace.  In the artist's words, art should "provoke greater social awareness and responsibility," and this work demonstrates how this can be accomplished.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The array of subway and rail lines at the Atlantic Avenue-Pacific Street and LIRR's Terminal presented a perfect opportunity for an "architect/artist" collaboration to unify passages and stairways, creating a coherent and efficient space.  George Trakas  uses forms and materials that underscore the structure and beauty of the cavernous space. *Trakas selected the stone pavers and bollards for the plaza area.  The architects designed a skylight for the historic station kiosk and Trakas added a small peephole equipped with a lens that provides a view from the street to the light-filled space below.  The viewer spies a boat-shaped gantry of stainless steel and mesh beneath the skylight.  A granite "wave" runs along the walls and crests at the point where the two stations, Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Street, meet - linking the passageways.  Referencing the names {Atlantic} and {Pacific}, the overarching concept is a place of landing and departure - functions shared by train stations and seaports.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Owen Smith designed this brilliantly colored mosaic work with Brooklyn riders in mind, as "a celebration of the working people who have made the subway what it is today."  The  subject matter is the subway's creation and importance.  Smith said, "The west wall depicts the designers and engineers who achieved this great engineering feat.  The north wall pays tribute to the workers who dug the tunnels and laid the 680 miles of track.  And the third panel represents the people who use the subway every day and whose lives are improved by it."  Smith highlights popular pastimes and haunts in the murals; on the Manhattan-bound side the Rockettes are seen kicking their heels, and on the Brooklyn-bound platform Smith depicts a brownstone with Coney Island in the background.  Smith cites Diego Rivera and other WPA era muralists as influences, and designed his murals in their spirit.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{My Coney Island Baby} at the Stillwell Avenue subway terminal is big, bold, and attention-grabbing.  Images are silk-screened onto glass bricks that form a Vista glass-brick wall.  In the artist's words, "I see a glass wall built as a celebration of life and joy containing all sorts of different images relating to the history of one of the greatest landmarks in the city, Coney Island."  The popular image of Coney Island is the amusement park and beach, but the neighborhood is also solidly residential.  {My Coney Island Baby} focuses on this variety, featuring the recreational attractions as well as the people who live, work, and play here.  As light conditions change {My Coney Island Baby} does as well.  In daylight, with the sun streaming in, its images and colors are boldly illuminated.  At night it glows from within, adding mystery to the surroundings.  Wilson is internationally known for his work in experimental theater and here he brings his visionary stagecraft to public art with great effect.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>With the renovation of the Stillwell Avenue Coney Island Terminal, a new building was constructed, with a retail arcade along the passage to the trains.  Architects Di Domenico   Partners, refer to it as "a collage of elements that recall the 'Playland' character of Coney Island's past and strike the spark that will shape the area's future." Vel Riberto Consulting and Fisher Marantz Renfro Stone were instrumental in the lighting of the project; it evokes the original Coney Island amusements, including Steeplechase Park, and Luna Park.  While most of the building is new, important historic elements from the earlier structure were  preserved.  Here, Arts for Transit led the efforts to conserve and reintroduce rather than replace the parapet from the original building along with 'BMT Lines" medallion and BMT logo in green and red glazes.  Conservator Alan Farancz preserved these historic elements. *{Arts for Transit's mission includes maintaining historic elements when they can be integrated into rehabilitation, thereby linking the old with the new.}</art2_description>
