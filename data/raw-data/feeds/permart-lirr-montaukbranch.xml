		<art1_description>The new MTA Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn features an artist/architect collaboration in a soaring, light-filled atrium. The project architects, di Domenico + Partners collaborated with the artists, Allan Wexler and Ellen Wexler, to create a special place of arrival in the entry pavilion which reaches from the street level down to the ticket office, waiting room and LIRR and NYC Transit subways. *The Wexlers created a two-story sculptural balcony and wall that visually evokes the adventure of travel. Titled {Overlook}, its rocky granite form cantilevers above the main concourse at the Terminal, referencing scenic overlooks often found in national parks, where travelers are encouraged to pause and take in the larger scene. The bands of granite also refer to nature found underground in layers of rock. Allan Wexler commented, "We sought to create the experience of viewing an urban public space as if it were a nature setting, using granite tiles mathematically pixilated to create nooks and crannies found in rock walls." Ellen Wexler said, "We wanted to create a space where one can stop and take in the dynamic energy, which is as exciting as stopping to take in the Grand Canyon or other major vista". *{Overlook} is framed by a pair of sweeping staircases and a glass and stainless steel balcony/railing that flows with the architecture of the space, which promises to be a Brooklyn landmark, akin to Grand Central Terminal's famous clock. *Allan Wexler and Ellen Wexler have created public art works nationwide, often using familiar forms imbued with new meanings and functions, fostering a new way of looking at or using the specific site. The materials used often are construction materials, as in the case of {Overlook}.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Brit Bunkley created a suite of modern architectural elements that overlay the station's columns.  The cast stone elements include round medallions, symbolic of clocks, at each end of the station that are set above framed icons representing local history and transportation.  To highlight the advantages of public transportation, the artist created a frieze portraying cars in a traffic jam.  "Since I thought the architecture of the waiting areas looked like a 'Prairie Style Doric Temple,' I designed the extended lintel as a Prairie Style window-like structure (which also mimics the LIRR train windows)," says the artist.  "The images within... include pleasure boats, a beach umbrella/arrow with egg (a reference to the egg and dart molding), and a Fire Island lighthouse as a chess piece."  Taken together, the work adds visual interest and a holiday spirit to both a commuter station and a major launching point for visits to the seashore.</art1_description>
