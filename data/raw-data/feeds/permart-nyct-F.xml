		<art1_description>{Passage} was designed in tandem with the architects, FX + FOWLE, as an integral part of the station.  It features trapezoidal-shaped windows fitted into the steel so they can be opened and allow air into the platform.  The laminated, impact-resistant security glass is layered with a plasma composite material to break up light into the colors of the spectrum.  The artist has said that {Passage} is influenced by the markets, flowers, and colors on the nearby streets.  Tom Patti pioneered the integration of industrial and architectural glass into art.  "The ability of glass to occupy several physical states - transparent, opaque, dense, solid, weightless - all altering our spatial boundary - challenges me," he says.  All of {Passage}'s components were handmade in his studio.  This act of craftsmanship is critical, says Patti, to ensure the integrity of all elements.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>One of the largest artworks in the MTA system runs under 42nd Street along the corridor connecting the B, D, F, V lines with the 7 train.  Above the site is the Main Library and Bryant Park, which are reflected in the artwork below.  On the walls of the tunnel we see rock outcroppings, tree roots, pipes, animal burrows, and literary quotations.  The artist based the project on the idea of systems.  In her words, "People travel the subway system, water and other utility services are delivered by pipes, and plants and trees that provide grace and softness against the city's sharper edges find their way to water and nutrients underground through a system of roots.  In a similar way, literature is shared by systems of learning and lending, and many animals inhabit systems of burrows just as humans systematically divide portions of larger habitats aboveground."  At the west end of the tunnel, color asserts itself in a frieze of rock and plant forms with a quote from psychologist Carl Jung:  "Nature must not win the game, but she cannot lose."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Michele Oka Doner's {Radiant Site}, at the busy 34th Street-Herald Square subway station, fills a rectilinear floor-to-ceiling passage with golden light.  The midsection of the corridor is the brightest, glazed in copper-toned tiles; the tiles grow darker and reflect less light along the top and bottom of the passageway.  The result is a gently glowing surface.  The artist made the 11,000 tiles one-by-one by hand on a century-old foot-press at the venerable Pewabic Pottery in Detroit.  Their slightly irregular shapes and uneven surfaces were then hand-glazed, varying the recipe in tiny increments so as to achieve the desired luminosity.  Doner says that she considers not only the physical and chemical properties of the materials she will use but also "their psychic and cosmic qualities."</art1_description>

		<art2_description>A green painted rectangular structure is suspended from the subway platform and engages travelers with its ability to produce sounds.  Travelers place their hands in front of the box-like apparatus on the subway platform and a burst of musical notes are released on the opposite side, playing to the person on the other side.  The hand motions elicit an outpouring of sounds that evoke urban life and bring about duets between strangers waiting for their respective trains.  Artist Christopher Janney creates sound sculptures and public art that use sound and motion.  This work brings about interaction and pleased participants, serving in Janney's words, as "a foil for getting total strangers to interact with each other."</art2_description>

		<art3_description>In the 34th Street-Herald Square subway station riders are met by large, luminous orbs that seem to hover in space.  Made of coiled aluminum rods - formed in a manner similar to the way in which ceramicists build pots from clay - the spheres are suspended on a framework of small beams from the larger steel structural components of the station.  {Halo} contrasts the aesthetic with the utilitarian and the result is "an unexpected serenity."  The artist say, "It was my aim to create an enigmatic distribution of objects that would stand in sharp contrast to the rectilinear nature of the site, and in doing so, to establish an oasis of visual language amid an otherwise functional environment."</art3_description>

		<art4_description>A series of red wind paddles, each 12 long, hangs between the east wall of the station and each of the 14 columns that run the length of the wall.  The artist's concept was for the delicately balanced paddles to spin and flutter in the wind generated by approaching and departing trains.  From the artist's proposal:  "As every veteran subway rider knows - whether actively or intuitively - the approach of a train is preceded by a gust of wind funneling down the track. It's my interest to build and install a series of subway 'wind paddles' that will utilize and make visible these subterranean breezes.  The varying amounts of wind will set the brightly colored paddles floating, tilting, and spinning in descriptive patterns."</art4_description>

		<art1_date>1997</art1_date>
		<art1_material>Stainless steel and glass sculpture with lights on mezzanine column bases; ceramic tile on station walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>In {Signal}, artist Mel Chin, collaborating with Seneca tribe member Peter Jemison, draws upon the rich history of the Broadway and Lafayette crossroads, once a trading route for the tribes of the Six Nations.  The mezzanine wall tiles depict figures from the nations with arms out-stretched to one another.  The main concourse has conical forms at the base of support pillars shaped like campfires, used to send signals.  Lights within these "campfires" brighten as trains approach and dim as they leave.  Patterns within the steel forms derive from tribal badge patterns, that were based on a fusion of cultures.  Another historical overlay is in the tile patterns around the concourse, they evoke rising smoke while the pattern is inspired by an Iroquois message of peace.  In the artist's words, art should "provoke greater social awareness and responsibility," and this work demonstrates how this can be accomplished.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Ming Fay brings to the station the liveliness of the thriving marketplace overhead in this storied Lower East Side neighborhood.  The artist extensively researched the neighborhood's history, and created by watercolor sketches that were transformed into glass mosaic murals by craftsmen.  The images of Shad Crossing celebrate the return of the once abundant fish to New York and water as a metaphor for "crossing." {Delancey Orchard} is the mural on the Manhattan-bound platform, inspired by the prominent  DeLancey family's eighteenth century farm, which stretched from the East River to the Hudson River.  The farm's cherry orchard was located where Orchard Street stands and is memorialized with radiant cherry trees on the Brooklyn-bound platform.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The intricate play of nature is the theme of Ben Snead's mosaic and tile artwork, which fills the south mezzanine with bold color and intricate patterns along a specially designed 103 foot-long curved wall. The work exhibits the artist's interest in natural species and ways of arranging them in systems and patterns that highlight the connections and relationships between dissimilar species. *The artwork - created in glass mosaic based on Snead's original paintings - features species that have migrated to Brooklyn as well as one species that is departing.  He arranges the species in layers that can be seen from left to right: European starling (originally from England), a house sparrow (Europe), Red Lion fish (Indian Ocean), Monk parrot (South America) and Koi (Japan).  The Tiger Beetle is represented on a tile background; a local species that is in decline. The result is a bold and graphic set of images that intrigue and delight passersby during their own departures and arrivals.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Michael Krondl describes {Looking Up} as "a series of photographically-derived images" that creates a movie for the subway rider as he or she leaves the leafy residential neighborhoods and reaches Coney Island, seen of in the distance.  Krondl selected his images for their properties and how they reflect and refract light.  His sources include the nearby foliage and the sky, which is a big part of the experience of riding the elevated train in Brooklyn, and Coney Island's famous Cyclone roller coaster.  "The transition from image to image mimics a camera panning from the nearby trees to the sky above and finally to the Cyclone in the distance.  For the F train passenger the experience is almost cinematic.  The foliage, the clouds, and the roller coaster all play with transparency; light-colored sky outlines the trestlework on the Cyclone, peeks out between the leaves, and envelops the bright white clouds."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The inspiration for the station's design was local sites - the historic Coney Island boardwalk and Cyclone roller coaster, the aquarium next to the station, and area beaches.  The station is on the approximate site of a former roller coaster ride.  The architect, Jim McConnell of Daniel Frankfurt, wanted to transform the exterior station walls in a unique way.  Working with the architects, artist Vito Acconci developed an architectural treatment for the station fa&ccedil;ade that is full of life.  As in successful collaborations, there is no clear delineation between the architecture and the art. *Before rehabilitation, the windscreens blocked ocean views; the new windscreens open up the platform view of the Atlantic Ocean.   In the artist's words, "The normally horizontal and vertical steel windscreen tubes and panels have been transformed into a more sinuous form that evokes the notion of a wave, or that of motion as in the Cyclone or the subway itself."  The result is a striking and unique subway station that fits into its special surroundings.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>{My Coney Island Baby} at the Stillwell Avenue subway terminal is big, bold, and attention-grabbing.  Images are silk-screened onto glass bricks that form a Vista glass-brick wall.  In the artist's words, "I see a glass wall built as a celebration of life and joy containing all sorts of different images relating to the history of one of the greatest landmarks in the city, Coney Island."  The popular image of Coney Island is the amusement park and beach, but the neighborhood is also solidly residential.  {My Coney Island Baby} focuses on this variety, featuring the recreational attractions as well as the people who live, work, and play here.  As light conditions change {My Coney Island Baby} does as well.  In daylight, with the sun streaming in, its images and colors are boldly illuminated.  At night it glows from within, adding mystery to the surroundings.  Wilson is internationally known for his work in experimental theater and here he brings his visionary stagecraft to public art with great effect.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>With the renovation of the Stillwell Avenue Coney Island Terminal, a new building was constructed, with a retail arcade along the passage to the trains.  Architects Di Domenico   Partners, refer to it as "a collage of elements that recall the 'Playland' character of Coney Island's past and strike the spark that will shape the area's future." Vel Riberto Consulting and Fisher Marantz Renfro Stone were instrumental in the lighting of the project; it evokes the original Coney Island amusements, including Steeplechase Park, and Luna Park.  While most of the building is new, important historic elements from the earlier structure were  preserved.  Here, Arts for Transit led the efforts to conserve and reintroduce rather than replace the parapet from the original building along with 'BMT Lines" medallion and BMT logo in green and red glazes.  Conservator Alan Farancz preserved these historic elements. *{Arts for Transit's mission includes maintaining historic elements when they can be integrated into rehabilitation, thereby linking the old with the new.}</art2_description>
