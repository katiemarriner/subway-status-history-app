		<art1_description>The new MTA Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn features an artist/architect collaboration in a soaring, light-filled atrium. The project architects, di Domenico + Partners collaborated with the artists, Allan Wexler and Ellen Wexler, to create a special place of arrival in the entry pavilion which reaches from the street level down to the ticket office, waiting room and LIRR and NYC Transit subways. *The Wexlers created a two-story sculptural balcony and wall that visually evokes the adventure of travel. Titled {Overlook}, its rocky granite form cantilevers above the main concourse at the Terminal, referencing scenic overlooks often found in national parks, where travelers are encouraged to pause and take in the larger scene. The bands of granite also refer to nature found underground in layers of rock. Allan Wexler commented, "We sought to create the experience of viewing an urban public space as if it were a nature setting, using granite tiles mathematically pixilated to create nooks and crannies found in rock walls." Ellen Wexler said, "We wanted to create a space where one can stop and take in the dynamic energy, which is as exciting as stopping to take in the Grand Canyon or other major vista". *{Overlook} is framed by a pair of sweeping staircases and a glass and stainless steel balcony/railing that flows with the architecture of the space, which promises to be a Brooklyn landmark, akin to Grand Central Terminal's famous clock. *Allan Wexler and Ellen Wexler have created public art works nationwide, often using familiar forms imbued with new meanings and functions, fostering a new way of looking at or using the specific site. The materials used often are construction materials, as in the case of {Overlook}.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>At Valley Stream Station a series of mosaic works fills the new platform waiting room with works of calming color and charming vistas.  *Portraying the skies and scenery of the area, Swedish-born and Brooklyn-based artist Malin Abrahamsson creates a broad swath of green bands punctuated with more detailed mosaics of local sights, such as a pair of Canadian Geese, a house, and the nearby clock tower. *Two other large mosaic panels hang above the west stairway and escalator, showing a pale blue sky with a touch of green at the bottom, a seagull in flight, and floating clouds. The works bring to commuters a painter's sensibility with views of the rolling lawns and shrubs of the close-by suburbs, under expansive skies.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Hand-painted porcelain tile on platform columns</art1_material>
		<art1_description>Mounted on the elevated train platform's concrete pillars, the series consists of eight panels of hand, painted tile that depict the community's past and its links to the nearby sea.  As the artist described the concept,   "I will create a series of tiles tracing the history of Long Island, beginning in the Ice Age, through paintings of rocks and plant life. The next stage would show how the Native Americans interacted with plants and sea life, followed by the first Europeans, who settled in Long Island and established farms and a seafaring industry.  Later, a tourist industry developed, as well as several advanced industries. ... The early history of Merrick describes developed grain farms with cows and sheep.... The railroad eventually became a bridging device to bring together the surrounding communities and contributed greatly to the development of contemporary Long Island."  The artwork was created in conjunction with the installation at the Bellmore Station, the station east of Merrick.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>At the Seaford Station 14 laminated glass windows extend the sky, creating a bright blue fantasy filled with butterflies and birds, their flights traced with dots of clear glass that meander, overlap and reveal paths of movement, speaking to migration and the act of travel.  The dots also transform the sunlight and enliven the landscape.  Artist Carson Fox used bird and butterfly images inspired from Victorian era engravings, an aesthetic where natural life is a lush and swarming profusion.  *They were created from a process that includes painting on the glass. The 14 windows, eight on the north side of the waiting room and six on the south,  combine to create a special place for commuters as they mark the start of their day in a space made radiant by the artist's vision.</art1_description>
