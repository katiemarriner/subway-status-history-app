		<art1_description>{Uptown New York}, a colorful, airy celebration of apartment life in the Bronx, is the centerpiece of the Tremont Avenue subway station's renovation.  Drawn from his childhood memory, artist Frank Hampton created a tableau taken from the viewpoint of an actual rooftop location.  The viewer, looking through a building, sees the neighbors' furniture, the continuing view of nearby rooftops, other apartment buildings, and beyond to the skyscrapers of Manhattan.  "I grew up in the Bronx gazing out of apartment windows that look out onto fire escapes, store signs, laundry, and buildings upon buildings," said Hampton.  "These have always seemed like mosaics to me, colorful, interacting, and in constant motion.  Windows played the role of a yard I didn't have."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Vito Acconci creates the 161st Street Yankee Stadium station as an archaeological site and dislocates walls that allow the curious to "see" the stone and steel underneath.  Elsewhere, protruding and receding walls provide seating for waiting travelers.  Parts of the project thrust through floors and ceilings and at one point even project aboveground.  The overall effect is as if the station has been pushed and pulled in various directions to accentuate the relationship of the building to the earth into which it has been inserted. *This project was one of the first collaborative efforts undertaken by Arts for Transit. The architects, di Domenico   Partners, in their redesign of the station, were challenged to open the lower levels to allow light to flow inside.</art1_description>

		<art2_description>At the Yankee Stadium elevated station, walls that open in Vito Acconci's shifting architectural forms reveal Helene Brandt's Room of Tranquility where all is peaceful, still, and reassuring.  Trees and sky seem real; the space appears to expand and depth is convincingly suggested.  In the artist's words, "I envisioned an imaginary room revealed behind the sliding tile walls - a quiet, restful space with a radiant view to the outside, a room of tranquility.  I wanted the room to have illusionary windows that would seem to let the outside world penetrate into the station."  Brandt rose to the challenge of responding to the site with a work that relates to Acconci's in counterpoint.  As she stated, "I want my {Room of Tranquility} to look as if it has always existed and is only now exposed to view by the sliding tile walls."  Her site-specific achieves a place of serenity, yet close to the roar of the crowds.</art2_description>

		<art1_description>At Cathedral Parkway, Harlem's southern boundary, three large mosaic murals were created that refer to migration and African homelands.  "Overall, the panels present the ideas of uprooting, migration, and progress in symbolic form," says artist Christopher Wynter.  He further explains that the blocks of color differentiate various African ancestral homelands, and the circular symbol represents the {n'kis}, or sacred place concept, of the Nkongo people.  Houses on stilts suggest Central African buildings, while horizontal bands of color denote village paths.  Wheels and walking feet describe faraway destinations, according to Wynter, and reference the mass movements of Africans throughout history.  The station is located below Frederick Douglass Circle.  Douglass, the abolitionist crusader, is also depicted.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>In {For Want of a Nail}, the artist team used a variety of materials to suggest the range and diversity at the American Museum of Natural History, directly above the subway station.  Glass mosaic, glass tile, ceramic tile, granite, and bronze relief are combined in ways that highlight the ten key disciplines at the Museum. The mosaics represent extinct and living animals, the former in grey and the latter in color.  The work assembles images from outer space to the earth's core and from the first organisms to emerge to mammals of today.  The artwork was a collaboration between MTA Arts for Transit and the Museum.  {For Want of a Nail}, the title of an old proverb, asks the viewer to consider the way everything is connected.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>A monumental and vibrant porcelain tile wall drawing by Sol LeWitt has been installed at 59th Street-Columbus Circle. The artist created the proposal in 2004 and, working with Dattner Architects, selected the site in an expansive wall facing a double-wide stairway and landing that leads from the mezzanine to the platforms of the A, C, B, D and 1 trains. Titled {Whirls and twirls (MTA)}, the artwork is 53 feet wide and by 11 feet high and consists of 250 porcelain tiles in six colors, each cut to meet the artist's specifications. The artist created the drawing/maquette for the project, reviewed and selected materials, and approved color samples prior to his death in 2007. *The artist is known for his sculptures and his wall drawings, in which detailed directions are provided for the execution of the artwork in paint or pencil. The site-specific piece - unique because it is a permanent public installation of a wall drawing - is a bravura work of precision, with swooping curves and vertical and horizontal bars in vibrant color that completely fills the space. The tile was cut to the exact dimensions of the drawing to ensure that the scale of the work and the color sequences are as the artist intended. *Sol LeWitt (1928-2007) is a celebrated artist who has had hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries worldwide since 1965. His work includes more than 1,100 wall drawings, photographs, hundreds of works on paper, and geometry-based sculptures. An exhibition at Mass MOCA in North Adams, Massachusetts, features 105 wall drawings in a specially designed museum space and will be on view through 2033.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>One of the largest artworks in the MTA system runs under 42nd Street along the corridor connecting the B, D, F, V lines with the 7 train.  Above the site is the Main Library and Bryant Park, which are reflected in the artwork below.  On the walls of the tunnel we see rock outcroppings, tree roots, pipes, animal burrows, and literary quotations.  The artist based the project on the idea of systems.  In her words, "People travel the subway system, water and other utility services are delivered by pipes, and plants and trees that provide grace and softness against the city's sharper edges find their way to water and nutrients underground through a system of roots.  In a similar way, literature is shared by systems of learning and lending, and many animals inhabit systems of burrows just as humans systematically divide portions of larger habitats aboveground."  At the west end of the tunnel, color asserts itself in a frieze of rock and plant forms with a quote from psychologist Carl Jung:  "Nature must not win the game, but she cannot lose."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Michele Oka Doner's {Radiant Site}, at the busy 34th Street-Herald Square subway station, fills a rectilinear floor-to-ceiling passage with golden light.  The midsection of the corridor is the brightest, glazed in copper-toned tiles; the tiles grow darker and reflect less light along the top and bottom of the passageway.  The result is a gently glowing surface.  The artist made the 11,000 tiles one-by-one by hand on a century-old foot-press at the venerable Pewabic Pottery in Detroit.  Their slightly irregular shapes and uneven surfaces were then hand-glazed, varying the recipe in tiny increments so as to achieve the desired luminosity.  Doner says that she considers not only the physical and chemical properties of the materials she will use but also "their psychic and cosmic qualities."</art1_description>

		<art2_description>A green painted rectangular structure is suspended from the subway platform and engages travelers with its ability to produce sounds.  Travelers place their hands in front of the box-like apparatus on the subway platform and a burst of musical notes are released on the opposite side, playing to the person on the other side.  The hand motions elicit an outpouring of sounds that evoke urban life and bring about duets between strangers waiting for their respective trains.  Artist Christopher Janney creates sound sculptures and public art that use sound and motion.  This work brings about interaction and pleased participants, serving in Janney's words, as "a foil for getting total strangers to interact with each other."</art2_description>

		<art3_description>In the 34th Street-Herald Square subway station riders are met by large, luminous orbs that seem to hover in space.  Made of coiled aluminum rods - formed in a manner similar to the way in which ceramicists build pots from clay - the spheres are suspended on a framework of small beams from the larger steel structural components of the station.  {Halo} contrasts the aesthetic with the utilitarian and the result is "an unexpected serenity."  The artist say, "It was my aim to create an enigmatic distribution of objects that would stand in sharp contrast to the rectilinear nature of the site, and in doing so, to establish an oasis of visual language amid an otherwise functional environment."</art3_description>

The artist's concept was for the delicately balanced paddles to spin and flutter in the wind generated by approaching and departing trains.  From the artist's proposal:  "As every veteran subway rider knows - whether actively or intuitively - the approach of a train is preceded by a gust of wind funneling down the track. It's my interest to build and install a series of subway 'wind paddles' that will utilize and make visible these subterranean breezes.  The varying amounts of wind will set the brightly colored paddles floating, tilting, and spinning in descriptive patterns."</art4_description>

		<art1_material>Stainless steel and glass sculpture with lights on mezzanine column bases; ceramic tile on station walls</art1_material>
		<art1_description>In {Signal}, artist Mel Chin, collaborating with Seneca tribe member Peter Jemison, draws upon the rich history of the Broadway and Lafayette crossroads, once a trading route for the tribes of the Six Nations.  The mezzanine wall tiles depict figures from the nations with arms out-stretched to one another.  The main concourse has conical forms at the base of support pillars shaped like campfires, used to send signals.  Lights within these "campfires" brighten as trains approach and dim as they leave.  Patterns within the steel forms derive from tribal badge patterns, that were based on a fusion of cultures.  Another historical overlay is in the tile patterns around the concourse, they evoke rising smoke while the pattern is inspired by an Iroquois message of peace.  In the artist's words, art should "provoke greater social awareness and responsibility," and this work demonstrates how this can be accomplished.</art1_description>

		<art2_material>Hand painted panels, Lighting</art2_material>
		<art2_description>A disarmingly simple artwork, placed in the unused subway station at Myrtle Avenue in 1980, has been restored. {Masstransiscope} turns the subway into a movie machine, presenting a colorful, animated "moving picture" to commuters as the train moves through the tunnel. With heavy cleaning by volunteers, the artwork became visible again in 2008. *The artwork has been viewed by millions of commuters from subway cars leaving the northbound platform of the DeKalb Avenue station on the express track. The 228 hand-painted panels are viewed through a series of vertical slits set into a specially constructed housing that runs the full 300' length of the old station. The piece works on the principle of the Zoetrope, a 19th century optical toy. *The movement of the train passing in front of the exhibition creates the illusion of a 20-second animated movie. In a regular movie the film passes through a projector to create an illusion of motion and the audience sits still. With {Masstransiscope} it is the audience that moves while the film stays in place.</art2_description>

		<art1_description>The array of subway and rail lines at the Atlantic Avenue-Pacific Street and LIRR's Terminal presented a perfect opportunity for an "architect/artist" collaboration to unify passages and stairways, creating a coherent and efficient space.  George Trakas  uses forms and materials that underscore the structure and beauty of the cavernous space. *Trakas selected the stone pavers and bollards for the plaza area.  The architects designed a skylight for the historic station kiosk and Trakas added a small peephole equipped with a lens that provides a view from the street to the light-filled space below.  The viewer spies a boat-shaped gantry of stainless steel and mesh beneath the skylight.  A granite "wave" runs along the walls and crests at the point where the two stations, Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Street, meet - linking the passageways.  Referencing the names {Atlantic} and {Pacific}, the overarching concept is a place of landing and departure - functions shared by train stations and seaports.</art1_description>

		<art1_material>Ceramic mosaic on mezzanine</art1_material>
		<art1_description>For both the Prospect Park and Parkside Avenue stations, Susan Tunick created intricate, multicolored ceramic mosaic murals and borders.  These 1919 stations, with station booths and turnstiles located in above-ground "headhouses," feature wall tiles and decorative borders influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement.  Tunick's art celebrates the vintage ceramic ornamentation of the station and is inspired by her fascination with terra cotta and her childhood memories of nearby Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.  Tunick says her works for the sites, collectively titled {Brighton Clay Re-Leaf, Nos.1-4}, balance her respect for the stations' "ceramic history," her recollection of the colors and shapes of the foliage in the park and garden, and her desire to add eye-catching modern design, which is achieved in her use of bold color, pattern, and texture in the tiles.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>David Wilson's skylight fills the waiting area of this Brooklyn subway station with bright, clear light.  The panels are framed in blue and the pattern in the panes consists of black lines and solid panels in geometric form, that echoes the aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts movement and leaded glass work from that era, but with a more contemporary interpretation.  In Wilson's words, "I had been interested in the use of plastics and the possibility of "leadlines" that are not feasible in glass - thus the diagonal "cuts" going to nowhere in the piece (i.e. stopping in the middle of a color).  The project is a kind of architectural statement - a skylight set into a difficult environment (a steel I-beam divides the triangular window into two halves so that it is hard to read as a whole)."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>The artwork consists of brightly painted porcelain enamel panels that use symbols and figures to create a contemporary version of Egyptian hieroglyphs.  Against a blue background, large figures walk forward framed by symbols that represent subway visits and the nearby beach.  In the artist's words, "If public art is elegantly and permanently crafted, it will delight audiences of the present and the future, in the way the wall paintings of ancient civilizations delight us today..."</art1_description>

		<art1_description>At the turn of the twentieth century Sheepshead Bay was a popular tourist destination.  Historic sites and views from its past are portrayed in {Postcards from Sheepshead Bay}.  The large mural outdoors is an oversized replica of a vintage postcard that nostalgically shows a couple fishing, a jockey on horseback, and a summer home - as well as a sheepshead, the fish for which the village was named. DeBorah Goletz fancifully cut out the couples' faces, allowing people to "stick their heads through for souvenir photos, just like the old boardwalk props," she says.  Inside, another mural of turn-of-the-century people, and two smaller ones, capture quiet moments on the bay.  Goletz created intricately patterned tiles with color gradations from green to blue and back to green.  The results are rhythmic patterns that make one "feel" the water itself.</art1_description>

		<art1_description>Brighton Beach, near Coney Island, was once one of New York City's prime seaside entertainment and recreation areas.  "The sea is ancient, rich, and mysterious," says Dan George.  "I wanted {Dionysus} to intrigue people and to remind them of the sea's mythic history and thereby spark the creation of their own dreams and fantasies."  Dolphins - six pairs and a singleton - are used by the artist to depict the metamorphosis from human to animal.  These have a light and supple appearance, belying the materials from which they are made - sturdy, solid and durable aluminum plate and the way that natural light reflects off the water plays on the satiny polished finish and planes of the sculptures giving it  buoyancy.</art1_description>
