His original band {Chicken Wings} auditioned at the first MUNY Auditions in 1987, formalizing the underground performing they started in 1981. Influenced to come to New York by trombonist Joe Bowie and the band {Defunkt}, Alex's philosophy, &quot;swing 'till you drop'&quot; is best described in an NPR interview, &quot;You see the crowd...you get the beat right, you touch their heart. You try to put everything in that one note; the whole world in that one note.&quot;</biodescription>

		<biodescription>Born in Tunis, Najib Bahri is an inheritor of the Andalucian music tradition. He is a master percussionist on darbouka (goblet drum), bendir (frame drum), and riq (tambourine) in the Maghrebi classical and folk styles. Najib began playing darbouka at age eight with his father and uncles in theaters for Tunisian national television. At age 16 he attended the Tunisian National Conservatory of Music, and later, while studying in France, performed in Parisian nightclubs and other venues. Over the years, he has researched different world rhythms and accompanied some of the most prestigious musicians of the Arab world. *He prefers playing the traditional clay darbouka with the stingray skin because of the natural and fine acoustic qualities governed by the atmosphere, humidity, and temperature of the environment. Najib also leads the musical group El Amal (Arabic for "Hope") and offers a unique sound, which he coined North African dance grooves.</biodescription>

As part of their performances, Julie adds sidekick narratives and gossip to the music with drums, gongs, and bells. On the yangqin, a large-sized dulcimer, Xiao pulls all sorts of east and west material to allow the music to swing freely from scoreless folk songs to Pan-Asian pop, to Hollywood inspirations to self-styled fusion as heard on the streets of Beijing or Brooklyn. On the jembe, the wooden fish, or the big Tang drum and switching between Chinese and English, Julie spars with Xiao, thrilling audiences from Lincoln Center to Dollywood and at festivals from the Ozarks to Detroit.</biodescription>

		<biodescription>CAROLINA SLIM was born in Denmark, South Carolina, in 1926. His father, uncle, and older brother were all musicians and passed on their knowledge of the blues. To this day, Carolina Slim continues to champion the Piedmont Blues that he learned in his youth. This unique style, marked by its rich harmonies and poly-rhythmic finger-picking guitar patterns, is one of the great foundations of American music.  Carolina Slim migrated to New York as a young man, and has lived here and raised his family in the Big Apple. He has played an integral role as keeper of the blues idiom in New York City. His performances in the subway system as part of the MUNY program have been an essential ingredient in New York City culture and his mentoring of young musicians is another continuation of his legacy.</biodescription>

One reviewer said, "She does everything she can think of with that cello, short of setting it on fire. Her voice is gorgeous, and she sings her decidedly offbeat songs with a sort of dark abandon."  Leah veered off the road of rigorous traditional training after earning a degree in cello performance from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and doing a stint of graduate school at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. Over the years, Leah has played with many wonderful musicians including David Bowie, Michael Cerveris, Mark Mulcahy, Rufus Wainwright, Linda Thompson, and Lou Reed.

		<name_last>Freelance Whales</name_last>
		<biodescription>The five musicians who form Freelance Whales found one another in 2008 amid a strange amalgam of unfamiliar instruments and precariously composed pop songs. Using whatever musical gadgets they happened upon - harmonium, banjo, glockenspiel, synthesizers, guitars, bass, cello, drums, and waterphone - they worked at crafting songs with interlocking rhythmic patterns, lush textural layering, and an engaged group-vocal energy. Freelance Whales can be spotted in the streets and humble venues of NYC. Their first full-length recording 'weathervanes' is available on CDBaby. Freelance Whales toured all over US and Canada with Fanfarlo during November and December 2009. In January, they performed at NYC's Mercury Lounge.</biodescription>

On numerous occasions the two performers shared the stage and eventually became close friends. After months of rehearsals, several impressive gigs around New England and world-wide notice in an Associated Press article that featured the duo auditioning for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in Manhattan, the news is finally out: Gillen &amp; Turk are twisting their talent together into something new and exciting. *Gillen &amp; Turk present both their acoustic and electric repertoire in a fashion that bends toward the recognizable folk-rock genre without losing any respective idiosyncrasies. Harmonies abound, along with singing that's tough, sincere, full of heart and soul. Guitars are front and center. There is also some spirited playing of the washboard and mandolin.</biodescription>

		<biodescription>AMOS WENGLER The bard of Coney Island, Amos Wengler with guitar in hand, has stepped into every major event taking place in Brooklyn's Coney Island for years. He has provided epic poetry and songs appropriate for the various occasions. Amos performs each year for the Polar Bear Club's dip into the icy Atlantic Ocean, acts as pied piper for the opening of Coney Island and the summer's Mermaid Parade, entertains at the July 4th Hot Dog Eating Contest, and participates in any cultural happening worthy of his talents. Aptly dubbed &quot;The Coney Island Songwriter,&quot; Amos' original songs and songwriting skills are recognized way beyond his locale and his repertoire of standards, including his incredible versions of the Beatles favorites. A true folk legend, Amos Wengler's ode to MUNY is included in a song.</biodescription>
